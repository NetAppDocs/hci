Before you use cloud services on NetApp HCI, your cloud administrator should have prepared networking and completed other requirements.â€‹
== System requirements
* A deployed NetApp HCI using the NetApp Deployment Engine.
* Upgraded NetApp HCI management services. See management services information in the NetApp Element User Guide.
* NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control available on the management node of your system.
* NetApp HCI management node 2.1 (requires updates from the 2.0 version shipped with the 19.1 release)
* Your version of VMware vCenter supported by the NetApp HCI Deployment Engine (NDE).

== NetApp Kubernetes Service requirements
* An NKS account.
* An NKS API token, which authorizes the installer to access the NKS organization. You can create this before or duing the process of enabling cloud services on NetApp HCI.  

== Networking requirements

* You should have already configured the required vSphere distributed switches (VDS). We do not support installing to other switches.
* You must have already configured the port groups (ports between the vCenter and the management node) in the NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server. We recommend creating three Kubernetes-specific port groups.

== Browser requirements
*	Any modern browser
