[.lead]
Before you use cloud services on NetApp HCI, your cloud administrator should have prepared networking and completed other requirements.â€‹

== System requirements
* A deployed NetApp HCI system v1.6 or later using the NetApp Deployment Engine
* Upgraded NetApp HCI management services. See management services information in the NetApp Element User Guide.
* NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control available on the management node of your system
* NetApp HCI management node 2.1 (requires updates from the 2.0 version shipped with the 19.1 release)
* Your version of VMware vCenter supported by the NetApp HCI Deployment Engine (NDE)

== System size Requirements
* 2x4 systems are not supported for production use. However, you can use these for demo work.
* 3x4 systems are the minimum production system size we support.
* 4x4 systems are the recommended minimum size.

== NetApp Kubernetes Service requirements
* An NKS account
* An NKS API token, which authorizes the installer to access the NKS organization. You can create this before or during the process of enabling cloud services on NetApp HCI.

== Networking requirements

* You must have already configured the required vSphere distributed switches (VDS). We do not support installing to other switches.
* You must have already configured the port groups (ports between the vCenter and the management node) in the NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server. A VDS port group is required for NetApp Kubernetes Service. We recommend creating three Kubernetes-specific port groups.
* You must have already configured the management node port group.

== Browser requirements
*	Any modern browser
