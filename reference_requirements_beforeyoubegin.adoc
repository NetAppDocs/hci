== System requirements
* A NetApp HCI 1.6 or later system deployed by the NetApp Deployment Engine
* Upgraded NetApp HCI management services. See management services information in the http://docs.netapp.com/sfe-113/topic/com.netapp.doc.sfe-ug/home.html[NetApp Element User Guide^].
* NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control available on the management node of your system
* NetApp HCI management node 2.1 (requires updates from the 2.0 version)
* Your version of VMware vCenter supported by the NetApp HCI Deployment Engine (NDE)

== System size requirements
* 2x4 systems are not supported for production use. However, you can use these for demo work.
* 3x4 systems are the minimum production system size we support.
* 4x4 systems are the recommended minimum size.

== NetApp Kubernetes Service requirements
* A NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS) account
* A NetApp Kubernetes Service API token, which authorizes the installer to access the NKS organization. You can create this before or during the process of enabling cloud services on NetApp HCI.

== Networking requirements

* You must have already configured the required vSphere distributed switches (VDS). We do not support installing to other switches.
* You must have already configured the port groups (ports between the vCenter and the management node) in the NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server. A VDS port group is required for NKS. We recommend creating three NKS-specific port groups.
* You must have already configured the management node port group.

== Browser requirements
*	Any modern browser
