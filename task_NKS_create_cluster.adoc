[.lead]
After you enable cloud services, you can create a Kubernetes workload cluster. You want to create clusters on which you can later place pre-designed or your own applications. After you create the clusters, those clusters are ready to accept application workloads.

.About this task
You create Kubernetes clusters, add them to a workspace, create a project within that workspace, and later add a solution to the project.

The NetApp Kubernetes Service is installed on a VMware virtual machine on a compute node using the NetApp HCI management node.

.Steps

. From NetApp Cloud Central, select *Products* > *NetApp Kubernetes Service*.
+
https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].
. Log in using your Cloud Central credentials.

. Configure your provider. Select the region, the workspace in which the cluster will be located, and SSH key pair for the cluster.
. To edit any of the default values for the cluster nodes, click *Edit* and customize the number, size, and disk space allotted to the cluster nodes. If there is more than one NetApp HCI installation in the organization, you can select additional systems.
. Click *Submit* to configure your cluster.
.	Configure your Kubernetes cluster by entering the cluster name and typically, by using the default settings.
.. Click *Submit*.

.Result
The NetApp Kubernetes Service creates the cluster and displays it on the Clusters page.
