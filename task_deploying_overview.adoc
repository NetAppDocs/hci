NetApp HCI​ installations connect to, register with, and become a deployable region with NetApp Cloud Central. Then, you can centrally manage Cloud Services for NetApp HCI on prem systems in the same way that you do in public clouds.

== Deployment overview

Deploying and configuring a NetApp HCI solution in the cloud involves these steps.  And, our updated user interfaces help you every step of the way:

* Deploy and configure NetApp HCI using the quick and easy NetApp Deployment Engine that you’ve used previously. [Link to NDE Guide in Doc Center]
* link:task_enabling_cloud_services.html[Enable cloud services] using the updated management node along with a new NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control wizard. You establish a connection to NetApp Cloud Central and authenticate and register your NetApp HCI installation to your Cloud Central account.
* link:task_NKS_create_cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes cluster] using the NetApp Kubernetes Service, one of many services located on NetApp Cloud Central.
* link:task_nks_creating_projects[Create a Kubernetes project]
* link:task_NKS_adding_application[Add applications to your Kubernetes clusters]
* link:task_dfo_creating_cloud_volumes[Create cloud volumes] using NetApp Fabric Orchestrator.
