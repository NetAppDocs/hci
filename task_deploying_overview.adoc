NetApp HCI​ installations connect to, register with, and become a deployable region with NetApp Cloud Central. With this, you can centrally manage cloud services for NetApp HCI on-premise systems in the same way that you do in public clouds.

== Deployment overview

Deploying and configuring a NetApp HCI solution in the cloud involves these steps.  Our user interfaces help you every step of the way:
