== What happens behind the scenes?

Behind the scenes, NetApp HCI creates a bootstrap agent that establishes the initial communication tunnel to the NetApp Kubernetes Service Controller, builds a temporary bootstrap cluster, and creates a service cluster. The service cluster, connected to NetApp Kubernetes Service, acts as a service orchestrator to deploy services and update itself.

The NetApp Kubernetes Service agent maintains the tunnel, creates user clusters, and maintains previously deployed services.
