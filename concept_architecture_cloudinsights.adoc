NetApp Cloud Insights monitors compute, network, storage stack and application statuses for multi-vendor, heterogenous services and now provides analytics on NetApp HCI services.

You can quickly ascertain the health of your cloud services and see information like this:

* Number of Kubernetes clusters
* Number of pods
* Network throughput
* Cluster latency
* CPU utilization on virtual machines
* IOPs
* and much more

This NetApp Cloud Insights Dashboard shows analytics for NetApp Kubernetes Service clusters and pods.

== A unique NetApp HCI Data Collector

Each vendor for which Cloud Insights provides analytics has its own Data Collector running on a central Acquisition Unit that connects with and collects stack metrics. Similarly, Cloud Insights employs a unique Data Collector for NetApp HCI. Getting a new Data Collector deployed is easy with a task of less than a minute.
Enter just the Data Collector-specific information in a web form and then the Data Collector is up and running.
