== A unique NetApp HCI Data Collector

Each vendor for which Cloud Insights provides analytics has its own Data Collector running on a central Acquisition Unit that connects with and collects stack metrics. Similarly, Cloud Insights employs a unique Data Collector for NetApp HCI. Getting a new Data Collector deployed is easy with a task of less than a minute.
Enter just the Data Collector-specific information in a web form and then the Data Collector is up and running.
