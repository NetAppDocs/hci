Enabling NetApp cloud services on NetApp HCI provides access to Kubernetes clusters and cloud volumes on NetApp HCI.
Enabling cloud services is performed using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.

.About this task

A wizard takes you through the following tasks:

* Select the cloud services you want to enable.
* Obtain a Kubernetes API token and register your installation with NetApp Cloud Central.
*	Select the vCenter resources.
*	Configure networking.

== Signing in to or registering with NetApp Cloud Central

. Access NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) by opening a web browser and browsing to the IP address of the management node:
"https://<_ManagementNodeIP_>"

. On the Enable NetApp Cloud Services tile in the Hybrid Cloud Control wizard, click *Enable*.
. If you do not have a Cloud Central account, on the https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] Login page, click *Sign Up*.
Using Cloud Central, you can set up accounts either as individual accounts or as Federated accounts:

* You can make a new account with name, email, and password and then you will be logged in. This is the simplest type of account.
* If you are part of a Cloud Central Federated organization, you enter your email and are then routed to the organization login.

. On the Cloud Central page, enter your Cloud Central login credentials and click *Login*.

== Selecting the Cloud Services you want to enable
. On the Enable Cloud Services > Services page, select the services that you want to enable:
* *NetApp Kubernetes Service*: You must use NetApp Kubernetes Service, a SaaS platform that enables you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud. This is required to enable cloud services on NetApp HCI. This service is installed as a VM on a NetApp HCI compute node.
* *Cloud Volumes*: To manage cloud volumes on NetApp HCI, select this. This service offers an on-demand shared file systems feature on your premises. The Cloud Volulmes option enables Data Fabric replication to and from public clouds.
* *Cloud Insights*: To monitor cloud services on NetApp HCI, select this.

+
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED as a TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW. You might see a different set of services than those listed above.

. Click *Continue*.


== Getting a Kubernetes API token
Enabling cloud services for NetApp HCI requires a NetApp Kubernetes Service API token that is associated with your Cloud Central account. You can complete these steps prior to enabling cloud services or during the process.

. On the Enable Cloud Services > NetApp Cloud Central page, click the *API token* link to get a Kubernetes Service API token if you do not already have one.

. Enter a token name and click *Create*.

. Copy the token.
. Return to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control and paste it into the NetApp Kubernetes Service API Token field.

+

+
. Click *Connect*.
+
The registration is now established and you are connected to Cloud Central. The Organization and Region Name fields appear listing the datacenters and regions available for this Cloud Central connection.
+

== Registering your installation with NetApp Cloud Central

. On the Enable Cloud Services page, select your Cloud Central organization and region name.
+
This region name is used to identify this NetApp HCI installation and is used as the site name for any NetApp Kubernetes clusters created on this installation.
. Click *Continue* to go to the vCenter Resources page.

== Selecting the vCenter resources

. On the vCenter page, enter or select the following:
.. *Datacenter*:  Select a datacenter from those configured on the NetApp HCI system.
.. *Cluster*: Select a cluster from those configured on the NetApp HCI system.
+
The vCenter instance and administrative user connected to it is displayed.
+

+
. Click *Continue* to go to the Networking page.


== Selecting networking options

.	On the Networking page, review the hover text for each of the following an configure networking information:
* *NetApp Kubernetes Service Management Network*: Enter IP addresses and information needed for service and workload clusters for the NetApp Kubernetes Service.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service Workload Network*: Enter network information needed to support your workload clusters, on which you place your applications. When you create your workload clusters, NetApp Kubernetes Service uses the IP addresses entered here.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service Data Network*: Enter network information needed to connect your Kubernetes workload clusters to persistent volume claims (PVCs) on your NetApp HCI system.
.	Click *Continue*.
.	On the Review page, review your choices by expanding each option. and click *Continue*.

.Result
NetApp HCI cloud services are enabled and the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control opening page reappears. The Enable NetApp Cloud Services tile on this page shows the number of services enabled. During the process, you can close the window at any time.

NetApp HCI uses the NetApp Kubernetes Service to create a service cluster, which is a Kubernetes cluster that consists of four VMs (one Kubernetes master node and three Kubernetes worker compute nodes).
