[.lead]
NetApp HCI works with multiple NetApp cloud services.

The following NetApp cloud services are supported on NetApp HCI:

* *NetApp Kubernetes Service*: Provides a Kubernetes application marketplace, Compute as a Service, and application orchestration from NetApp HCI. This service is a requirement for cloud services on NetApp HCI.
* *NetApp Cloud Insights*: Provides analytics for the compute, network, and storage stack for cloud services, including NetApp HCI.
* *NetApp Cloud Volumes*: Provides ONTAP on-premise or private cloud as a service. After deploying NKS on NetApp HCI, you can create applications that reside on cloud volumes.
* *NetApp Fabric Orchestrator*: Provides a centralized storage and data management control plane for fabric-wide, multi-cloud visibility, monitoring, policies, administration and workflow orchestration for NetApp storage systems on-premises and in the cloud.

== Components

The following components are used for cloud services on NetApp HCI:

*	*NetApp Deployment Engine*: Deploys NetApp HCI.
*	*NetApp HCI management node*: Establishes a connection to NetApp Cloud Central and authenticates and registers the NetApp HCI installation to a Cloud Central account. You can use the management node also to update management service bundles.
* *NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control*: Deploys and configures NetApp HCI Element and enables cloud services on NetApp HCI.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service agent*: Maintains a communication tunnel between NKS and NetApp HCI, creates user clusters, and maintains deployed cloud services.
