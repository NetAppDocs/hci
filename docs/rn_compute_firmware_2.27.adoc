** Change the option *Attempt Fast Cold Boot* default to `disable`
** Change the option *Allow Correctables* default to `enable`
* *H410C BMC 6.71.18*: Add BMC reporting for ePPR memory SEL events
* *H610C BMC 4.00.07*: Add remote syslog support
* *H615C BMC 4.68.07*: Add remote syslog support

=== Mellanox NIC firmware driver compatibility
The updated Mellanox firmware versions 14.25.1020 and 14.24.1000 are compatible only with the following versions of the VMware ESXi driver:

* ESXi 6.5: Version 4.16.13.5
* ESXi 6.7: Version 4.17.15.16

NOTE: Before upgrading to version 2.27, make sure you check the current ESXi driver version.  If the driver is out of date, upgrade the driver first. Then upgrade the compute firmware to version 2.27 for your compute nodes.

To download the compute node firmware package:

. Go to https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/netapp-hci/downloads-tab[the NetApp HCI downloads page^].
. Choose *Compute_Firmware_Bundle* from the drop down list.
. Click *Go*.

== Resolved issues
The following are issues that have been resolved in this release.

|===
|Issue |Description

|N/A
|The redundant memory correctable error that is triggered by a routine memory error check has been resolved in H615C BIOS 3B08.CO.

|CSD-3321 / CSESF-129
|The BMC can hang and become inaccessible with the error `BMC Self Test Failed`. This is resolved in H610C BMC 4.00.07 and H615C BMC 4.68.07.

|CSESF-234
|The H610C BMC web UI inventory API returns the wrong memory serial number format. This is resolved in H610C BMC 4.00.07.

|PE-6708
|The Bonded NIC pair does not fail over to secondary when the NIC goes down or the port is disabled. This is resolved in Mellanox firmware 14.24.1000.
|===

== Known issues
The following are known issues in this release that might affect daily operation in some environments.

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|CSESF-295
|The compute node firmware update process fails with a BIOS update error when you update the firmware on a H410C node using the downloadable firmware package.
|Manually update the BIOS to version NA3.7 on the H410C node:
1. Browse to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/netapp-hci/downloads-tab[NetApp HCI Downloads page^].
2. Enter `H410C_BIOS_3.7` in the drop down list text field.
3. Click *Go*.
Instructions for updating are available in PDF format on the download page.

After you update the BIOS and BMC, update the H410C node firmware using the compute firmware 12.2.109 package.

|CSESF-328
|On H410C and H300E/H500E/H700E nodes, one NIC sensor for Mellanox NIC in BMC reports status as "NA" and reads "not present"
|None

|CSESF-309
|H410C and H300E/H500E/H700E nodes are unable to bring the Mellanox NIC port up after manually bringing the port down when running VMware EXSi 6.7u1.
|Run the following command to recover the ports: `sxcli network nic set -n vmnic2 -a`

|CSESF-303
|Network stats errors are observed for Mellanox NIC on H410C
|None

|CSESF-293 / PE-10130
|Mellanox NIC firmware can be downgraded by compute firmware 12.2.91
|If you want to upgrade other firmware on H410C or H300E/H500E/H700E and upgrade Mellanox NIC out-of-band; then do following in the order specified:
1. Upgrade other firmware via compute firmware bundle 12.2.91
2. Upgrade Mellanox firmware via out-of-band methods

|PE-11033
|Under heavy loads, the expected vmnic0 link message is sometimes missing from H615C node log files.
|None

|PE-11032
|Under heavy loads, transmit errors sometimes occur for the Mellanox NIC on H610C nodes.
|None

|PE-10954
|H610C nodes sometimes reflect the incorrect MTU setting after you set the MTU using the Element software Terminal User Interface (TUI).
|None
