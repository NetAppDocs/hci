=== Mellanox NIC firmware driver compatibility
The updated Mellanox firmware versions 14.25.1020 and 14.24.1000 are compatible only with the following versions of the VMware ESXi driver:

* *ESXi 7.0*: H300E/H500E/H700E/H410C: Version 4.19.16.1
* *ESXi 7.0*: H610C/H615C: Version 4.17.15.16
* *ESXi 6.7*: Version 4.17.15.16
* *ESXi 6.5*: Version 4.16.13.5

NOTE: Before upgrading to version 2.27, make sure you check the current ESXi driver version.  If the driver is out of date, upgrade the driver first. Then upgrade the compute firmware to version 2.27 for your compute nodes. Visit link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_drivers.html[Update compute node drivers^] for instructions on updating your compute node drivers, which include the ESXi driver.

While NetApp Deployment Engine 1.8P1 does not deploy ESXi version 7.0, ESXi 7.0 is supported as a self-install or manual upgrade option. When you manually install or upgrade host OSes, NetApp cannot control the drivers and firmware for these OSes.

Visit link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_firmware.html#use-the-baseboard-management-controller-bmc-user-interface-ui[Update compute node firmware^] for instructions on updating your compute node firmware.

== Resolved issues
The following are issues that have been resolved in this release.

|===
|Issue |Description

|CSD-3321 / CSESF-129
|The BMC can hang and become inaccessible with the error `BMC Self Test Failed`. This is resolved in H610C BMC 4.00.07 and H615C BMC 4.68.07.

|CSESF-234
|The H610C BMC web UI inventory API returns the wrong memory serial number format. This is resolved in H610C BMC 4.00.07.

|PE-6708
|The Bonded NIC pair does not fail over to secondary when the NIC goes down or the port is disabled. This is resolved in Mellanox firmware 14.24.1000.
|===

== Known issues
The following are known issues in this release that might affect daily operation in some environments.

|===
|Issue |Description |Workaround

|CSESF-295
|The compute node firmware update process fails with a BIOS update error when you update the firmware on a H410C node using the downloadable firmware package.
a|Manually update the BIOS to version NA3.7 on the H410C node:

. Browse to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/netapp-hci/downloads-tab[NetApp HCI Downloads page^].
. Enter `H410C_BIOS_3.7` in the drop down list text field.
. Click *Go*.
Instructions for updating are available in PDF format on the download page.

After you update the BIOS and BMC, update the H410C node firmware using the compute firmware bundle 2.27 package.

|CSESF-328
|On H410C and H300E/H500E/H700E nodes, one NIC sensor for the Mellanox NIC in the BMC reports status as "NA" and reads "not present".
|None

|CSESF-309
|H410C and H300E/H500E/H700E nodes are unable to bring the Mellanox NIC port up after manually bringing the port down when running VMware EXSi 6.7u1.
|Run the following command to recover the ports: `esxcli network nic set -n vmnic2 -a`

|CSESF-303
|Network statistics errors are seen for the Mellanox NIC on H410C nodes.
|None

|CSESF-293 / PE-10130
|Mellanox NIC firmware can be downgraded by Bootstrap OS after you upgrade to the Compute Firmware Bundle version 2.27.
|Reinstall Compute Firmware Bundle version 2.27.

|PE-11033
|Under heavy loads, the expected vmnic0 link message is sometimes missing from H615C node log files.
|None

|PE-11032
|Under heavy loads, transmit errors sometimes occur for the Mellanox NIC on H610C nodes.
|None

|PE-10954
|H610C nodes sometimes reflect the incorrect MTU setting after you set the MTU using the Element software Terminal User Interface (TUI).
|None
