To use NetApp HCI on NetApp HCI, you'll need to set up some user accounts.

== Encryption at Rest for storage nodes

NetApp HCI enables you to encrypt all data stored on the storage cluster.

All drives in storage nodes capable of encryption leverage AES 256-bit encryption at the drive level. Each drive has its own encryption key, which is created when the drive is first initialized. When you enable the encryption feature, a storage-cluster-wide password is created, and chunks of the password are then distributed to all nodes in the cluster. No single node stores the entire password. The password is then used to password-protect all access to the drives. The password is needed to unlock the drive and then not needed unless power is removed from the drive or the drive is locked.*

When you enable Encryption at Rest, performance and efficiency of the cluster is not affected. Additionally, if you remove an encryption-enabled drive or node from the cluster with the Element API or Element UI, Encryption at Rest is disabled on the drives. After you remove the drive, you can securely erase the drive wtih the SecureEraseDrives API method. If you forcibly remove a drive or node from the cluster, the data remains protected by the cluster-wide password and the driveâ€™s individual encryption keys.
