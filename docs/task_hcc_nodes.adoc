You can view both your storage and compute assets in your system and determine their IP addresses, names, and software versions.

You can view storage information for your two-, three-, and four-node systems and any NetApp HCI Witness Nodes associated with two-node or three-node clusters.
Witness Nodes manage quorum within the cluster; they are not used for storage. Witness Nodes are applicable only to NetApp HCI and not to all-flash storage environments.

For more about Witness Nodes, see link:concept_hci_nodes[Nodes definitions].

.Steps

. Open a web browser and browse to the IP address of the management node. For example:
+
----
https://_management_node_IP_
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the NetApp HCI storage cluster administrator credentials.
. In the left navigation blue box, select the NetApp HCI installation.
+
The Hybrid Cloud Control Dashboard appears.
. In the left navigation, click *Nodes*.
+
The Storage tab appears.

. On the *Storage* tab of the Nodes page, review the following information:
.. Two-node clusters: A “two-node” label appears on the Storage tab and the associated Witness Nodes are listed.
.. Three-node clusters: The storage nodes and associated Witness Nodes are listed. Three-node clusters have a Witness Node deployed on standby to maintain high availability in the case of node failure.
.. Four-node clusters: Storage node information appears. Witness Nodes do not apply.
. To view compute inventory information, click *Compute*.

TIP: To view the number of storage and compute resources, look at the Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) Dashboard. See link:task_hcc_dashboard.html[View storage and compute resources in HCC Dashboard].
