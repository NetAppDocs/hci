For existing Rancher deployments, beginning with management services 2.21.61, Rancher is no longer supported. If you upgrade to management services 2.21.61, you will not be able to manage, monitor, or upgrade Rancher for existing deployments or deploy Rancher on NetApp HCI systems using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control. If you have already deployed Rancher on your NetApp HCI system and are running management services 2.20.69 or earlier, you can continue to manage, monitor, and upgrade Rancher using the http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/hci19/docs/concept_rancher_product_overview.html[NetApp HCI 1.9 documentation^].
