For existing Rancher deployments, beginning with management services 2.21.61, Rancher is no longer supported. If you upgrade to management services 2.21.61, you cannot use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to manage, monitor, or upgrade Rancher for existing deployments or perform new deployments on NetApp HCI systems. If you have already deployed Rancher on your NetApp HCI system and are running management services 2.20.69 or earlier, you can continue to manage, monitor, and upgrade Rancher using the http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/hci19/docs/concept_rancher_product_overview.html[NetApp HCI 1.9 documentation^].
