You can power on compute resources for a NetApp HCI system after the scheduled outage is complete.

.Steps

. Power on compute nodes using the same steps you performed for powering on the storage nodes.
. When all the compute nodes are operational, log in to the ESXi host that was running the vCSA.
. Log in to the compute host and verify that it sees all the NetApp HCI datastores. For a typical NetApp HCI system, you should see all the ESXi local datastores and at least the following shared datastores:
----
NetApp-HCI-Datastore-[01,02]
----
. Assuming all storage is accessible, power on the vCSA and any other required virtual machines as follows:
.. Select the virtual machines in the navigator, select all the virtual machines that you want to power on, and click the *Power on* button.
. After you power on the virtual machines, wait for approximately 5 minutes and then use a web browser to navigate to the IP address or FQDN of the vCSA applicance.
+
If you do not wait long enough, a message appears stating that the vSphere Client web server is initializing.
. After the vSphere Client initializes, log in and verify that all ESXi hosts and virtual machines are online.
