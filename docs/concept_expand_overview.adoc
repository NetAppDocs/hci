You can expand your NetApp HCI system with additional compute or storage nodes. â€‹

== What you can do with cloud services on NetApp HCI

*	Deploy services across cloud providers and your private cloud.
*	Interact with NetApp HCI as you would with any other supported cloud provider.
*	Port the apps and data across a hybrid cloud architecture regardless of cloud location without compromising service-level agreements.
*	Spin up cloud-native applications yourself. See link:task_NKS_adding_applications.html[Adding applications to your Kubernetes cluster] using the NetApp Kubernetes Service.
* Create cloud volumes on the Kubernetes cluster by using the NetApp Fabric Orchestrator. See link:task_nks_overview.html[Managing Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI overview] information.
