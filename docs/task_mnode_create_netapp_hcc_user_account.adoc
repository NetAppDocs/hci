[.lead]
You should create a NetApp HCC role in vCenter to manually add vCenter assets (controllers) or compute nodes (nodes) to the management node post installation, or to modify existing controllers or nodes.

This NetApp HCC role limits your management node services view to NetApp-only assets.

.About this task

* This procedure describes the steps available in version 6.7 of vSphere. Your vSphere user interface might differ slightly from what is described depending on the version of vSphere installed. For additional help, see VMware vCenter documentation.
* To link:task_mnode_create_netapp_hcc_role_vcenter.html#create-a-new-netapp-hcc-role[create a new NetApp HCC role], you first set up a new user account in vCenter, create a NetApp HCC role, and then assign the user permissions.
* For NetApp ESXi host configurations, you should update the NDE-created user account to the new NetApp HCC role:
** Use link:task_mnode_create_netapp_hcc_role_vcenter.html#netapp-esxi-host-does-not-exist-in-a-vcenter-host-cluster[this option] if your NetApp ESXi host does not exist inside a vCenter host cluster
** Use link:task_mnode_create_netapp_hcc_role_vcenter.html#netapp-esxi-host-exists-in-a-vcenter-host-cluster[this option] if your NetApp ESXi host exists inside a vCenter host cluster
* You can link:task_mnode_create_netapp_hcc_role_vcenter.html#controller-asset-already-exists-on-the-management-node[configure a controller asset] that already exists on the management node.
* Use the new NetApp HCC role to  link:task_mnode_create_netapp_hcc_role_vcenter.html#add-an-asset-or-a-compute-node-to-the-management-node[add an asset or a compute node] to the management node.

[NOTE]
====
* Beginning with NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 5.0, to use https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/vcp/vcp_concept_linkedmode.html[vCenter Linked Mode^], you register the Element Plug-in from a separate management node for each vCenter Server that manages NetApp SolidFire storage clusters (recommended).
* Using NetApp Element Plug-in for vCenter Server 4.10 and earlier to manage cluster resources from other vCenter Servers using https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/vcp/vcp_concept_linkedmode.html[vCenter Linked Mode^] is limited to local storage clusters only.
