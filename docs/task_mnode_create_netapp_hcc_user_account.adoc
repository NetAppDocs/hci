[.lead]
You must create a NetApp HCC role in vCenter before adding vCenter assets (controllers) or compute nodes (nodes) to the management node. This NetApp HCC role limits your management node services view to NetApp only assets.

.About this task
* To create a new NetApp HCC role, you first set up a new user account, create a NetApp HCC role in vCenter, and then assign the user permissions.
* For NetApp host clusters and NetApp ESXi host configurations, you might need to assign the user permissions in vCenter.

== Set up a new user account
Perform the following steps to set up a new user account.

.Steps
.	Log into the vSphere Web Client as `\administrator@vsphere.local` or equivalent.
.	From the Menu, select *Administration*.
.	In the *Single Sign On* section, select *Users* and *Groups*.
.	In the *Domain* list, select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain.
.	Select *Add User*.
.	Complete the *Add User* form.

== Create a new NetApp HCC role in vCenter
Perform the following steps to create a new NetApp HCC role in vCenter.

.Steps
. Select *Edit Role*, and assign the required permissions.
. In the left navigation pane, select *Global*.
. Select *Diagnostics* and *Licenses*.
. In the left navigation pane, select *Hosts*.
. Select  *Maintenance*, *Power*, *Storage partition configuration*, and *Firmware*.
. Save as `NetApp Role`.

== Assign user permissions to vCenter
Perform the following steps to assign the user permissions to the new NetApp HCC role in vCenter.

.Steps
.	From the Menu, select *Hosts* and *Clusters*.
.	In the left navigation pane, select one of the following options:
* The top level vCenter.
* Your desired vCenter if you are in linked mode.
.	In the right navigation pane, select *Permissions*.
.	Select the *+* icon to add the new user.
+
Add the following details in the *Add permission* window:

..	Select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain
..	Use the search to find the new user that you created in <<Set up a new user account>>.
..	Select `NetApp Role`.

IMPORTANT: Do *NOT* select  *Propagate to children*.

== Assign user permissions to a NetApp host cluster
Perform the following steps to assign the user permissions to a NetApp host cluster in vCenter.

.Steps
. In the left navigation pane, select the NetApp host cluster.
. In the right navigation pane, select *Permissions*.
. Select the *+* icon to add the new user.
+
Add the following details in the *Add permission* window:

.. Select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain.
.. Use the search to find the new HCC user that you created in <<Set up a new user account>>.
.. Select `NetApp Role` or `Administrator`.
.. Select *Propagate to children*.

== Add an asset to the management node
Use the new HCC user account that you created in <<Set up a new user account>> to add assets to the management node. See link:task_mnode_add_assets.html[Add compute and controller assets to the management node].

== Add NetApp compute and hardware (BMC) assets
Perform the following steps to add NetApp compute and hardware (BMC) assets to the management node by using `POST /assets/{asset_id}/controllers`.

.Steps
. Access the mnode service API UI on the management node by entering the management node IP address followed by `/mnode`:
+
`https://[management node IP]/mnode`
. Select *Authorize* and enter the credentials to access the API calls.
. Select `GET /assets` to get the parent ID.
. Select `POST /assets/{asset_id}/controllers` to add the controller.
.. Enter the credentials created in the account setup in the request body.

== Other configurations

=== NetApp ESXi host does not exist inside a vCenter host cluster
If the NetApp ESXi host does not exist inside a vCenter host cluster, you can use the following procedure to assign the NetApp HCC role and user permissions in vCenter.

.Steps

. From the Menu, select *Hosts* and *Clusters*.
. In the left navigation pane, select the NetApp ESXi host.
. In the right navigation pane, select *Permissions*.
. Select the *+* icon to add the new user.
+
Add the following details in the *Add permission* window:

.. Select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain.
.. Use the search to find the new user that you created in <<Set up a new user account>>.
.. Select `NetApp Role` or `Administrator`.
. Select *Propagate to children*.

=== NetApp ESXi host exists in a vCenter host cluster
If a NetApp ESXi host exists in a vCenter host cluster with other vendor ESXi hosts, you can use the following procedure to assign the NetApp HCC role and user permissions in vCenter.

. From the Menu, select *Hosts* and *Clusters*.
. In the left navigation pane, expand the desired host cluster.
. In the right navigation pane, select *Permissions*.
. Select the *+* icon to add the new user.
+
Add the following details in the *Add permission* window:

.. Select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain.
.. Use the search to find the new user that you created in <<Set up a new user account>>.
.. Select `NetApp Role`.
+
IMPORTANT: Do *NOT* select *Propagate to children*.

. In the left navigation pane, select a NetApp ESXi host.
. In the right navigation pane, select *Permissions*.
. Select the *+* icon to add the new user.
+
Add the following details in the *Add permission* window:

.. Select `vsphere.local` or your LDAP domain.
.. Use the search to find the new user that you created in <<Set up a new user account>>.
.. Select `NetApp Role` or `Administrator`.
.. Select *Propagate to children*.
. Repeat for remaining NetApp ESXi hosts in the host cluster.

=== Controller asset already exists on the management node
If a controller asset already exists on the management node, perform the following steps to configure the controller by using `PUT /assets /{asset_id} /controllers /{controller_id}`.

.Steps
. Access the mnode service API UI on the management node:
+
`https://[management node IP]/mnode`
. Select *Authorize* and enter the credentials to access the API calls.
. Select `GET /assets` to get the parent ID.
. Select `PUT /assets /{asset_id} /controllers /{controller_id}`.
.. Enter the credentials created in account setup in the request body.
