You can replace a faulty dual inline memory module (DIMM) in NetApp HCI compute nodes instead of replacing the entire node.

.What you'll need
* Before starting this procedure, you should have contacted NetApp Support and received a replacement part. Support will be involved during the installation of the replacement. If you have not done so already, contact https://www.netapp.com/us/contact-us/support.aspx[Support].
* You have planned for system downtime, because you need to power down or cycle the node and boot the node to NetApp Safe Mode to access the terminal user interface (TUI).

.About this task
This procedure applies to the following compute node models:

* H410C nodes. An H410C node is inserted into a 2U NetApp HCI chassis.
* H610C node. An H610C node is built into the chassis.
* H615C node. An H615C node is built into the chassis.
+
IMPORTANT: H410C and H615C nodes include DIMMs from different vendors. Ensure that you do not mix DIMMs from different vendors in one chassis.
+
NOTE: The terms "chassis" and "node" are used interchangeably in the case of H610C and H615C, because the node and chassis are not separate components.

Here are the steps involved in replacing DIMMs in compute nodes:

* <<Prepare to replace the DIMM>>
* <<Replace the DIMM from the chassis>>

== Prepare to replace the DIMM
When issues with the DIMM occur, VMware ESXi displays alerts, such as `Memory Configuration Error`, `Memory Uncorrectable ECC`, `Memory Transition to Critical`, and `Memory Critical Overtemperature`. Even if the alerts disappear after a while, the hardware problem might  persist. You should diagnose and address the faulty DIMM. You can get information about the faulty DIMM from vCenter Server. If you need more information than what is available from vCenter Server, you must run the hardware check in the TUI.

.Steps

. Identify the slot that logged the error as follows:
.. For H615C, do the following:
... Log in to the BMC UI.
... Select *Logs & Reports* > *IPMI Event Log*.
... In the event log, find the memory error and identify the slot on which the error is logged.
+

.. For H410C, do the following:
... Log in to the BMC UI.
... Select *Server Health* > *Health Event Log*.
... In the event log, find the memory error and identify the slot on which the error is logged.
+

. Perform the steps to identify the DIMM manufacturer part number.
+
IMPORTANT: H410C and H615C nodes include DIMMs from different manufacturers. You should not mix different DIMM types in the same chassis. You should identify the manufacturer of the faulty DIMM and order a replacement of the same type.
+
.. Log in to the BMC to launch the console on the node.
.. Press *F2* on the keyboard to get to the *Customize System/View Logs* menu.
.. Enter the password when prompted.
+
NOTE: The password should match what you configured in the NetApp Deployment Engine when you set up NetApp HCI.
+

.. From the System Customization menu, press the down arrow to navigate to Troubleshooting Options, and press *Enter*.
+

.. From the Troubleshooting Mode Options menu, use the up or down arrow to enable ESXi shell and SSH, which are disabled by default.
.. Press the <Esc> key twice to exit Troubleshooting Options.
.. Run the `smbiosDump` command using one of the following options:

. Contact NetApp Support for help with the next steps. NetApp Support requires the following information to process a part replacement:
* Node serial number
* Cluster name
* System event log details from the BMC UI
* Output from the `smbiosDump` command

== Replace the DIMM from the chassis
Before you physically remove and replace the faulty DIMM in the chassis, ensure that you have performed all the link:task_hci_dimmcomputerepl.html#prepare-to-replace-the-dimm[preparatory steps].

IMPORTANT: DIMMs should be replaced in the same slots they were removed from.

.Steps

. Access the node by logging in to vCenter Server.
. Right-click the node that is reporting the error, and select the option to place the node in maintenance mode.
. Migrate the virtual machines (VMs) to another available host.
+
NOTE: See the VMware documentation for the migration steps.

. Power down the chassis or node.
+
NOTE: For a H610C or H615C chassis, power down the chassis. For H410C nodes in a 2U, four-node chassis, power down only the node with the faulty DIMM.

. Remove the power cables and network cables, carefully slide the node or chassis out of the rack, and place it on a flat, antistatic surface.
+
TIP: Consider using twist ties for cables.

. Put on antistatic protection before you open the chassis cover to replace the DIMM.
. Perform the steps relevant to your node model:

|===

. Insert the power cables and network cables.
Ensure that all the port lights turn on.
. Press the power button at the front of the node if it does not power on automatically when you install it.
. After the node is displayed in vSphere, right-click the name and take the node out of maintenance mode.
. Verify the hardware information as follows:
.. Log in to the baseboard management controller (BMC) UI.
.. Select *System > Hardware Information*, and check the DIMMs listed.

.What's next

After the node returns to normal operation, in vCenter, check the Summary tab to ensure that the memory capacity is as expected.

NOTE: If the DIMM is not installed correctly, the node will operate normally but with lower than expected memory capacity.

TIP: After the DIMM replacement procedure, you can clear the warnings and errors on the Hardware Status tab in vCenter. You can do this if you want to erase the history of errors related to the hardware that you replaced. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2011531[Learn more^].
