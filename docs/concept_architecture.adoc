NetApp HCI along with NetApp Kubernetes Service enables you to deploy your applications as you would with a public cloud providerâ€”all in a self-service mode without IT involvement. This enables you to treat your datacenter as a deployable region of your multi-cloud.

== Components

The following components are used for cloud services on NetApp HCI:

*	*NetApp Deployment Engine*: Deploys NetApp HCI.
*	*NetApp HCI management node*: Establishes a connection to NetApp Cloud Central and authenticates and registers the NetApp HCI installation to a Cloud Central account. You can use the management node also to update management service bundles.
* *NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control*: Deploys and configures NetApp HCI Element and enables cloud services on NetApp HCI.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service agent*: Maintains a communication tunnel between NKS and NetApp HCI, creates user clusters, and maintains deployed cloud services.
