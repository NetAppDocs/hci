=== Mellanox NIC firmware driver compatibility
The updated Mellanox firmware versions 14.25.1020 and 14.24.1000 are compatible only with the following versions of the VMware ESXi driver:

* *ESXi 7.0*: H300E/H500E/H700E/H410C: Version 4.19.16.1
* *ESXi 7.0*: H610C/H615C: Version 4.17.15.16
* *ESXi 6.7*: Version 4.17.15.16
* *ESXi 6.5*: Version 4.16.13.5

NOTE: Before upgrading to version 2.146, make sure you check the current ESXi driver version. If the driver is out of date, upgrade the driver first. Then upgrade the compute firmware to version 2.146 for your compute nodes. Visit link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_drivers.html[Update compute node drivers] for instructions on updating your compute node drivers, which include the ESXi driver.

While NetApp Deployment Engine 1.8P1 does not deploy ESXi version 7.0, ESXi 7.0 is supported as a self-install or manual upgrade option. When you manually install or upgrade host OSes, NetApp cannot control the drivers and firmware for these OSes.
