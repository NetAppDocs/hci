When you use USB, SD card, or NVDIMM boot media, keeping the compute node system logs on that media results in frequent writes to that media. This can, over time, degrade the boot media. Use the instructions in the following KB article to move host logging to a shared storage location and relocate the core dump file location, which can help prevent degradation of the boot media over time and also help prevent errors due to full boot media.
