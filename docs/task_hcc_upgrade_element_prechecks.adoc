[.lead]
You must run health checks prior to upgrading Element storage to ensure all storage nodes in your cluster are ready for the next Element storage upgrade.

.What you'll need

* *Management services*: You have updated to the latest management services bundle (2.10.27 or later).
+
IMPORTANT: You must upgrade to the latest management services bundle before upgrading your Element software.

* *Management node*: You are running management node 11.3 or later.
* *Element software*: Your cluster version is running NetApp Element software 11.3 or later.
* *End User License Agreement (EULA)*: Beginning with management services 2.20, you must accept and save the EULA before using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI or API to run Element storage health checks:
+
. Open the IP address of the management node in a web browser:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Select *Upgrade* near the top right of the interface.
. The EULA pops up. Scroll down, select *I accept for current and all future updates*, and select *Save*.
+
NOTE: When you accept the EULA, it is recorded for all future updates and the automatic download feature is enabled. You will receive updates on NetApp software updates and upgrades, which you can install at your discretion and convenience. You can disable the automatic download feature by disabling network connectivity to the NetApp online software repository.

.Health check options

You can run health checks using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) UI, HCC API, or the HealthTools suite:

* <<Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage>> (Preferred method)
* <<Use API to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage>>
* <<Use HealthTools to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage>>

You can also find out more about storage health checks that are run by the service:

* <<Storage health checks made by the service>>

== Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage

Using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC), you can verify that a storage cluster is ready to be upgraded.

.Steps

. Open the IP address of the management node in a web browser:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Select *Upgrade* near the top right of the interface.
. On the *Upgrades* page, select the *Storage* tab.
. Select the health check image:hcc_healthcheck_icon.png[icon] for the cluster you want to check for upgrade readiness.
. On the *Storage Health Check* page, select *Run Health Check*.
. If there are issues, do the following:
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, select *Re-Run Health Check*.

After the health check completes without errors, the storage cluster is ready to upgrade. See storage node upgrade link:task_hcc_upgrade_element_software.html[instructions] to proceed.

== Use API to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage
You can use REST API to verify that a storage cluster is ready to be upgraded. The health check verifies that there are no obstacles to upgrading, such as pending nodes, disk space issues, and cluster faults.

.Steps

. Locate the storage cluster ID:
.. Open the management node REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>/mnode
----
.. Select *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Select *Authorize* to begin a session.
... Close the authorization window.
.. From the REST API UI, select `GET /assets`.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. From the response, copy the `"id"` from the `"storage"` section of the cluster you intend to check for upgrade readiness.
+
NOTE: Do not use the `"parent"` value in this section because this is the management node’s ID, not the storage cluster’s ID.

.. Copy the `healthCheckID` that is part of response.
. Verify the results of the health checks:
.. Select *GET ​/health-checks​/{healthCheckId}*.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Enter the health check ID in the parameter field.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. Scroll to the bottom of the response body.
+
If all health checks are successful, the return is similar to the following example:
+
----
"message": "All checks completed successfully.",
"percent": 100,
"timestamp": "2020-03-06T00:03:16.321621Z"
----

. If the `message` return indicates that there were problems regarding cluster health, do the following:
.. Select *GET ​/health-checks​/{healthCheckId}/log*
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Enter the health check ID in the parameter field.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. Review any specific errors and obtain their associated KB article links.
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, run *GET ​/health-checks​/{healthCheckId}/log* again.

== Use HealthTools to run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage

You can verify that the storage cluster is ready to be upgraded by using the `sfupgradecheck` command. This command verifies information such as pending nodes, disk space, and cluster faults.

If your management node is at a dark site without external connectivity, the upgrade readiness check needs the `metadata.json` file you downloaded during link:task_upgrade_element_latest_healthtools.html[HealthTools upgrades] to run successfully.

.About this task

This procedure describes how to address upgrade checks that yield one of the following results:

* Running the `sfupgradecheck` command runs successfully. Your cluster is upgrade ready.
* Checks within the `sfupgradecheck` tool fail with an error message. Your cluster is not upgrade ready and additional steps are required.
* Your upgrade check fails with an error message that HealthTools is out-of-date.
* Your upgrade check fails because your management node is on a dark site.

.Steps

. Run the `sfupgradecheck` command:
+
----
sfupgradecheck -u <cluster-user-name> MVIP
----
+
NOTE: For passwords that contain special characters, add a backslash (`\`) before each special character. For example, `mypass!@1` should be entered as `mypass\!\@`.

+
Sample input command with sample output in which no errors appear and you are ready to upgrade:
+
----
sfupgradecheck -u admin 10.117.78.244
----
+

----
. Download a link:https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMLP2840740[JSON file^] from the NetApp Support Site on a computer that is not the management node and rename it to `metadata.json`.
. Run the following command:

== Storage health checks made by the service
Storage health checks make the following checks per cluster.

|===
| Check Name | Node/Cluster | Description

| check_async_results | Cluster | Verifies that the number of asynchronous results in the database is below a threshold number.

| check_cluster_faults | Cluster | Verifies that there are no upgrade blocking cluster faults (as defined in Element source).

| check_upload_speed | Node | Measures the upload speed between the storage node and the management node.

| connection_speed_check | Node | Verifies that nodes have connectivity to the management node serving upgrade packages and estimates connection speed.

| check_cores | Node | Checks for kernel crash dump and core files on the node. The check fails for any crashes in a recent time period (threshold 7 days).

| check_root_disk_space | Node | Verifies the root file system has sufficient free space to perform an upgrade.

| check_var_log_disk_space | Node | Verifies that `/var/log` free space meets some percentage free threshold. If it does not, the check will rotate and purge older logs in order to fall under threshold. The check fails if it is unsuccessful at creating sufficient free space.

| check_pending_nodes | Cluster | 	Verifies that there are no pending nodes on the cluster.
