[.lead]
If you require technical support for your NetApp HCI or SolidFire all-flash storage system, NetApp Support can connect remotely with your system. To start a session and gain remote access, NetApp Support can open a reverse Secure Shell (SSH) connection to your environment.

.About this task
You can open a TCP port for an SSH reverse tunnel connection with NetApp Support. This connection enables NetApp Support to log in to your management node. If your management node is behind a proxy server, the following TCP ports are required in the sshd.config file:

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="15,25,60"]
|===
| TCP port
| Description
| Connection direction
| 443 | API calls/HTTPS for reverse port forwarding via open support tunnel to the web UI | Management node to storage nodes
| 22 | SSH login access | Management node to storage nodes or from storage nodes to management node
|===

NOTE: By default, the capability for remote access is enabled on the management node. To disable remote access functionality, see link:task_mnode_ssh_management.html[Manage SSH functionality on the management node]. You can enable remote access functionality again, if needed.

.Steps
* Log in to your management node and open a terminal session.
* At a prompt, enter the following:
+
`rst -r  sfsupport.solidfire.com -u element -p <port_number>`

* To close the remote support tunnel, enter the following:
+
`rst --killall`
