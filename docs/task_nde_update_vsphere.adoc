After deploying NetApp HCI, you should use VMware vSphere Lifecycle Manager to apply the latest security patches for the version of VMware vSphere used with NetApp HCI.

Use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Interoperability Matrix Tool] to ensure that all versions of software are compatible. See the https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html[VMware vSphere Lifecycle Manager documentation] for more information.
