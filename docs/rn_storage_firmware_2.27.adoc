[.lead]
Starting with Element 12.0 and management services version 2.14, you can perform firmware-only upgrades on your storage nodes using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI and REST API. This procedure does not upgrade Element software and enables you to upgrade storage firmware outside of a major Element release.

IMPORTANT: For H610S storage nodes running Element software version 12.0, you should apply D-patch SUST-909 before you upgrade to storage firmware bundle 2.27. Contact NetApp Support to obtain the D-patch before you upgrade.

== What's New
The storage firmware bundle version 2.27 contains various bug fixes and new features, including security vulnerability fixes. You can upgrade the storage firmware using the instructions in link:task_hcc_upgrade_storage_firmware.html[Upgrade storage firmware].
