The content in this section introduces recommended upgrade sequences for components in a NetApp HCI system or SolidFire all-flash storage system. â€‹

*System upgrade sequences* content describes the tasks that are needed to complete a NetApp HCI system or SolidFire all-flash storage system upgrade. Ideally these procedures are performed as part of the larger upgrade sequence and not in isolation. If a component-based upgrade or update is needed, see the procedure prerequisites to ensure additional complexities are addressed.

*vSphere upgrade sequences including Element Plug-in for vCenter Server* content describes additional pre- and post-upgrade steps required to re-install the Element Plug-in for vCenter Server.

* link:task_hcc_upgrade_all.html[Upgrade your NetApp HCI installation for version 1.9].
* link:task_sf_upgrade_all.html[Upgrade your NetApp SolidFire all-flash storage system for Element 12.3].

== vSphere upgrade sequences including Element Plug-in for vCenter Server

Choose one of the following sequences based on your system:

* link:task_hci_upgrade_all_vsphere.html[Upgrade your vSphere components for a NetApp HCI system with the Element Plug-in for vCenter Server].
