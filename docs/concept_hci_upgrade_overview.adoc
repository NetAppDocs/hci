The content in this section introduces recommended upgrade sequences for components in a NetApp HCI system or standalone SolidFire all-flash storage system. â€‹

*Upgrade sequence overviews* content describes end-to-end upgrades for NetApp and VMware components. There are also sequences that focus only on the NetApp components if you are not also upgrading vSphere-based software.

*System upgrade procedures* content describes the tasks that are needed to complete a system upgrade. Ideally these procedures are performed as part of a larger upgrade sequence and not in isolation. If a component-based upgrade or update is needed, see the procedure prerequisites to ensure additional complexities are addressed.
