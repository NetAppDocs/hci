[.lead]
You must run health checks prior to upgrading compute firmware to ensure all compute nodes in your cluster are ready to be upgraded. Compute node health checks can only be run against compute clusters of one or more managed NetApp HCI compute nodes.

.What you'll need

* *Management services*: You have updated to the latest management services bundle (2.11 or later).
* *Management node*: You are running management node 11.3 or later.
* *Element software*: Your storage cluster is running NetApp Element software 11.3 or later.
* *End User License Agreement (EULA)*: Beginning with management services 2.20.69, you must accept and save the EULA before using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI or API to run compute node health checks:
+
. Open the IP address of the management node in a web browser:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Select *Upgrade* near the top right of the interface.
. The EULA pops up. Scroll down, select *I accept for current and all future updates*, and select *Save*.

.Health check options

You can run health checks using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI or NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control API:

* <<Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware>> (Preferred method)
* <<Use API to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware>>

You can also find out more about compute node health checks that are run by the service:

* <<Compute node health checks made by the service>>

== Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware

Using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control, you can verify that a compute node is ready for a firmware upgrade.

NOTE: If you have multiple two-node storage cluster configurations, each within their own vCenter, Witness Nodes health checks might not report accurately. Therefore, when you are ready to upgrade ESXi hosts, you must only shut down the Witness Node on the ESXi host that is being upgraded. You must ensure that you always have one Witness Node running in your NetApp HCI installation by powering off the Witness Nodes in an alternate fashion.

.Steps

. Open the IP address of the management node in a web browser:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>/hcc
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Select *Upgrade* near the top right of the interface.
. On the *Upgrades* page, select the *Compute firmware* tab.
. Select the health check image:hcc_healthcheck_icon.png[icon] for the cluster you want to check for upgrade readiness.
. On the *Compute Health Check* page, select *Run Health Check*.
. If there are issues, the page provides a report. Do the following:
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, select *Re-Run Health Check*.

After the health check completes without errors, the compute nodes in the cluster are ready to upgrade. See  link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_firmware.html[Update compute node firmware] to proceed.

== Use API to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware

You can use REST API to verify that compute nodes in a cluster are ready to be upgraded. The health check verifies that there are no obstacles to upgrading, such as ESXi host issues or other vSphere issues. You will need to run compute node health checks for each compute cluster in your environment.

.Steps

. Locate the controller ID and cluster ID:
.. Open the inventory service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>/inventory/1/
----
.. Select *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Select *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. From the REST API UI, select *GET ​/installations*.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. From the code 200 response body, copy the `"id"` for the installation you plan to use for health checks.
.. From the REST API UI, select *GET ​/installations​/{id}*.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Enter the installation ID.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. From the code 200 response body, copy the IDs for each of the following:
... The cluster ID (`"clusterID"`)
... A controller ID (`"controllerId"`)

            "virtualMachineCount": 2
          }
        }
      ],
----
. Run health checks on the compute nodes in the cluster:
.. Open the compute service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>/vcenter/1/
----
.. Select *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Select *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. Select *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks*.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Enter the `"controllerId"` you copied from the previous step in the *Controller_ID* parameter field.
.. In the payload, enter the `"clusterId"` that you copied from the previous step as the `"cluster"` value and remove the `"nodes"` parameter.
+
----
{
  "cluster": "domain-1"
}
----
.. Select *Execute* to run a health check on the cluster.
+
The code 200 response gives a `"resourceLink"` URL with the task ID appended that is needed to confirm the health check results.
+
----
{
  "resourceLink": "https://10.117.150.84/vcenter/1/compute/tasks/[This is the task ID for health check task results]",
  "serviceName": "vcenter-v2-svc",
  "taskId": "ab12c345-06f7-42d7-b87c-7x64x56x321x",
  "taskName": "VCenter service health checks"
}
----
.. Copy the task ID portion of the `"resourceLink"` URL to verify the task result.
. Verify the result of the health checks:
.. Return to the compute service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>/vcenter/1/
----
.. Select *GET /compute​/tasks/{task_id}*.
.. Select *Try it out*.
.. Enter the task ID portion of the `"resourceLink"` URL from the *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks* code 200 response in the `task_id` parameter field.
.. Select *Execute*.
.. If the `status` returned indicates that there were problems regarding compute node health, do the following:
... Go to the specific KB article (`KbLink`) listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
... If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
... After you have resolved cluster issues, run *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks* again (see step 2).

If health checks complete without issues, the response code 200 indicates a successful result.

== Compute node health checks made by the service
Compute health checks, whether performed by NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control or API methods, make the following checks per node. Depending on your environment, some of these checks might be skipped. You should re-run health checks after resolving any detected issues.
