= Run compute node health checks prior to upgrading compute firmware

:hardbreaks:

[.lead]
You must run health checks prior to upgrading compute firmware to ensure all compute nodes in your cluster are ready to be upgraded.

You can run health checks using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) UI or HCC API:

* <<Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware>> (Preferred method)
* <<Use API to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware>>

You can also find out more about compute node health checks that are run by the service:

* <<Compute node health checks made by the service>>

.What you'll need

* You have updated to the latest management services bundle (2.11 or later).
* You are running management node 11.3 or later.
* Your cluster version is running NetApp Element software 11.3 or later.

== Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware

Using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC), you can verify that a compute node is ready for a firmware upgrade.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and browse to the IP address of the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Click *Upgrade* near the top right of the interface.
. On the *Upgrades* page, select the *Compute firmware* tab.
. Click the health check image:hcc_healthcheck_icon.png[icon] for the cluster you want to check for upgrade readiness.
. On the *Compute Health Check* page, click *Run Health Check*.
. If there are issues, do the following:
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, click *Re-Run Health Check*.

After the health check completes without errors, the compute nodes in the cluster are ready to upgrade. See  link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_firmware.html[Update compute node firmware] to proceed.

== Use API to run compute node health checks prior to upgrading firmware

You can use REST API to verify that compute nodes in a cluster are ready to be upgraded. The health check verifies that there are no obstacles to upgrading, such as ESXi host issues or other vSphere issues. You will need to run compute node health checks for each compute cluster in your environment.

.Steps

. Locate the controller ID and cluster ID:
.. Open the inventory service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://[management node IP]/inventory/1
----
.. Click *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Click *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. From the REST API UI, click *GET ​/installations*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Click *Execute*.
.. From the code 200 response body, copy the `"id"` for the installation you plan to use for health checks.
.. From the REST API UI, click *GET ​/installations​/{id}*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Enter the installation ID.
.. Click *Execute*.
.. From the code 200 response body, copy the IDs for each of the following:
... The cluster ID (`"clusterID"`)
... A controller ID (`"controllerId"`)

            "virtualMachineCount": 2
          }
        }
      ],
----
. Run health checks on the compute nodes in the cluster:
.. Open the compute service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://[management node IP]/vcenter/1
----
.. Click *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Click *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. Click *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Enter the `"controllerId"` you copied from the previous step in the *Controller_ID* parameter field.
.. In the payload, enter the `"clusterId"` that you copied from the previous step as the `"cluster"` value and remove the `"nodes"` parameter.
+
----
{
  "cluster": "domain-1"
}
----
.. Click *Execute* to run a health check on the cluster.
+
The code 200 response gives a `"resourceLink"` URL with the task ID appended that is needed to confirm the health check results.
+
----
{
  "resourceLink": "https://10.117.150.84/vcenter/1/compute/tasks/[This is the task ID for health check task results]",
  "serviceName": "vcenter-v2-svc",
  "taskId": "ab12c345-06f7-42d7-b87c-7x64x56x321x",
  "taskName": "VCenter service health checks"
}
----
.. Copy the task ID portion of the `"resourceLink"` URL to verify the task result.
. Verify the result of the health checks:
.. Return to the compute service REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://[management node IP]/vcenter/1
----
.. Click *GET /compute​/tasks/{task_id}*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Enter the task ID portion of the `"resourceLink"` URL from the *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks* code 200 response in the `task_id` parameter field.
.. Click *Execute*.
.. If the `status` returned indicates that there were problems regarding compute node health, do the following:
... Go to the specific KB article (`KbLink`) listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
... If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
... After you have resolved cluster issues, run *POST /compute​/{CONTROLLER_ID}​/health-checks* again (see step 2).

If health checks complete without issues, the response code 200 indicates a successful result.

== Compute node health checks made by the service
Compute health checks, whether performed by HCC or API methods, make the following checks per node.
