When you use NetApp HCI, you might need additional licenses depending on what you are using.

== NetApp HCI and VMware vSphere licensing
VMware vSphere licensing depends on your configuration:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]
|===
| Networking option
| Licensing
| Option A: Two cables for compute nodes using VLAN tagging (All compute nodes) | Requires use of vSphere Distributed Switch, which requires VMware vSphere Enterprise Plus licensing.
| Option B: Six cables for compute nodes using tagged VLANs (H410C 2RU 4-Node compute node)	 | This configuration uses vSphere Standard Switch as the default. Optional use of vSphere Distributed Switch requires VMware Enterprise Plus licensing.
| Option C: Six cables for compute nodes using native and tagged VLANs (H410C, 2RU 4-Node Compute Node) | This configuration uses vSphere Standard Switch as the default. Optional use of vSphere Distributed Switch requires VMware Enterprise Plus licensing.

== NetApp HCI and ONTAP Select licensing

If you were provided a version of ONTAP Select for use in conjunction with a purchased NetApp HCI system, the following additional limitations apply:

* The ONTAP Select license, which is bundled with a NetApp HCI system sale, may only be used in conjunction with NetApp HCI compute nodes.
* The storage for those ONTAP Select instances must reside only on the NetApp HCI storage nodes.
* The use of third-party compute nodes or third-party storage nodes is prohibited.
