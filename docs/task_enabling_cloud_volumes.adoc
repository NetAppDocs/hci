[.lead]
After you enable NetApp Kubernetes Service (NKS) on NetApp HCI, you might want to later enable the Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI.

Enabling cloud services is performed using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.

.About this task
This lets you use Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI on your on-premises private cloud.


A NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control wizard takes you through the following tasks:

* Select the Cloud Volumes service you want to enable.
* Enable licenses using a link to the NetApp License Generator.
*	Configure networking.

== Sign in to NetApp Cloud Central

. Access NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) by opening a web browser and browsing to the IP address of the management node:
"https://<_ManagementNodeIP_>"

For details, see http://docs.netapp.com/hci/topic/com.netapp.doc.hci-ude-170/GUID-6FC998B8-C6D4-48CF-A1A4-A762CC19092C.html[Accessing NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control^].

. Click the *Cloud* icon.
+
An outline of a cloud indicates that no services have been enabled. A filled in cloud indicates that some services have been enabled. This image shows that NKS has already been enabled, but Cloud Volumes has not yet been enabled.
. In the Cloud Services popup, review the services that are available.

. Click *Enable cloud services*.

== Select the Cloud Services you want to enable

SERVICES and INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED as a TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW. You might see a different set of services than those listed here.

. On the Services page, select the services that you want to enable.
* *NetApp Kubernetes Service*: This is enabled already. You must use NetApp Kubernetes Service, a SaaS platform that enables you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud with the major cloud providers and also with a NetApp private cloud. This is required to enable cloud services on NetApp HCI. This service is installed as a VM on a NetApp HCI compute node.
* *Cloud Volumes*: To install Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI, select this service. This service offers an on-demand shared file systems feature on your premises. The Cloud Volumes option will enable Data Fabric replication to and from public clouds.
* *Cloud Insights*: This option will enable you to monitor cloud services on NetApp HCI. _Coming soon_.

. Click *Continue*.



== Enter license information
If you enabled Cloud Volumes, a Licensing page appears.
The NetApp license files use the following format:
NLF<serialnumber>.txt

. If you already have obtained license files, click *Browse* to locate them.
Select both licenses and click *Choose* so they can be uploaded.
. If you have not obtained license files, complete the following to obtain or retrieve them:
.. Serial number information is provided in an email after ordering software. Go to the https://mysupport.netapp.com[NetApp Support Site^], click *Products* > *Software Licenses*, and
enter product and serial number.
.. Return to the Hybrid Cloud Control Licensing page, click the link to the NetApp License File Generator, supply your password, select “ONTAP Select-Premium” as the product line, and supply the product serial number that you obtained from the NetApp Support Site.

.. Acknowledge the Global Data Privacy Policy and click *Submit*.
.. Download the license files either directly from the NetApp License File Generator or from the email.
.. Do this twice for the two licenses, one for each of the HA clusters.
.. You can now upload the license files. In the Licensing page, click *Browse* to locate both license files that you downloaded. Select both licenses and click *Choose* to upload them.
. Click *Continue*.


== Select networking options

. If you enabled Cloud Volumes on the Services page, the following additional fields appear:
* *Cloud Volumes Management Network*: Enter the IP addresses for managing the Cloud Volumes deployment VM and its deployed nodes. These IP addresses are used during the installation to configure Cloud Volumes enablement.
* *Cloud Volumes Cluster Network*: Enter network information used by the cluster nodes used by Cloud Volumes deployment to communicate with each other.
* *Cloud Volumes Storage Network*: Enter network information to serve data from Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI. This will become the network from which you access provisioned
cloud volumes.

.	Click *Continue*.
.	On the Review page, review your choices by expanding each option. and click *Continue*.

.Result
Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI are enabled and the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control opening page reappears.

Click the cloud icon to see the number of services enabled.
The process can take up to 30 minutes for Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI.



== After you finish
To create cloud volumes, create custom data management workflows, and manage data across volumes, use NetApp Fabric Orchestrator. See link:task_cv_managing[Managing data in NetApp Cloud Volumes].
