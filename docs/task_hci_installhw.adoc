== Workflow diagrams

The workflow diagrams here provide a high-level overview of the installation steps. The steps vary slightly depending on the H-series model.

=== H410C and H410S in a two rack unit (2U), four-node chassis

=== H610C and H615C

NOTE: The terms "node" and "chassis" are used interchangeably in the case of H610C and H615C, because node and chassis are not separate components unlike in the case of a 2U, four-node chassis.

=== H610S

NOTE: The terms "node" and "chassis" are used interchangeably in the case of H610C and H615C, because node and chassis are not separate components unlike in the case of a 2U, four-node chassis.

== Prepare for installation

In preparation for installation, inventory the hardware that was shipped to you, and contact NetApp Support if any of the items are missing.

Ensure that you have the following items at your installation location:
* Rack space for the system. A NetApp HCI chassis with four nodes needs two rack unit (2U) rack space. An H610S node (or chassis) needs one rack unit (1U) rack space. An H610C node (or chassis) needs 2U rack space.
* SFP28/SFP+ direct-attach cables or transceivers
* CAT5e or higher cables with RJ45 connector
* A keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switch to configure your system
* USB stick (optional)

TIP: The hardware that is shipped to you depends on what you order. A new 2U, four-node order includes the chassis, bezel, slide rail kit, drives for storage nodes, storage and compute nodes, and power cables (two per chassis). If you order H610S storage nodes, the drives will come installed in the chassis.

== Install rails

The hardware order that was shipped to you includes a set of slide rails. You will need a screwdriver to complete the rail installation. The installation steps vary slightly for each node model.

TIP: Install hardware from the bottom of the rack up to the top to prevent the equipment from toppling over. If your rack includes stabilizing devices, install them before you install the hardware.

=== Two rack unit (2U), four-node NetApp HCI chassis
The 2U, four-node H-Series chassis is shipped with two sets of adapters. If you want to install the chassis in a rack with round holes, use the adapters appropriate for a rack with round holes. The rails for H410C and H410S nodes fit a rack between 29 inches and 33.5 inches in depth. When the rail is fully contracted, it is 28 inches long, and the front and rear sections of the rail are held together by only one screw.

CAUTION: If you install the chassis onto a fully contracted rail, the front and rear sections of the rail might separate.

.Steps

. Align the front of the rail with the holes on the front post of the rack.
. Push the hooks on the front of the rail into the holes on the front post of the rack and then down, until the spring-loaded pegs snap into the rack holes.
. Attach the rail to the rack with screws. Here is a illustration of the left rail being attached to the front of the rack:

. Extend the rear section of the rail to the rear post of the rack.
. Align the hooks on the rear of the rail with the appropriate holes on the rear post ensuring that the front and the back of the rail are on the same level.
. Mount the rear of the rail onto the rack, and secure the rail with screws.
. Perform all the above steps for the other side of the rack.

=== 2U H610C chassis

=== One rack unit (1U) H610S or H615C chassis
Here is an illustration for installing rails for an H615C compute node and an H610S storage node:

== Install the chassis


== Cable the nodes

To ensure network readiness for NetApp HCI, install the NetApp Configuration Advisor 5.8.1 or later. This network validation tool is located with other link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/5ddb829ebd393e00015179b2[NetApp Support Tools^]. Use this tool to validate connectivity, VLAN IDs, IP address requirements, switch connectivity and more.


== Configure NetApp HCI

The NDE UI is the software wizard interface used to install NetApp HCI.

== Perform post-configuration tasks

NetApp HCI uses a storage node management network IPv4 address for initial access to the NDE.  As a best practice, connect from the first storage node.

.Prerequisites
*	You already assigned the initial storage node management network IP address manually or by using DHCP.
*	You must have physical access to the NetApp HCI installation.

.Steps

. If you do not know the initial storage node management network IP, use the Terminal User Interface (TUI), which is accessed via keyboard and monitor on the storage node or https://docs.netapp.com/hci/topic/com.netapp.doc.hci-ude-180/GUID-511EA889-41D6-471A-BE84-C3146350A082.html[use a USB stick^].

. If you do know the IP address, from a web browser, connect to the Bond1G address of the primary node via HTTP, not HTTPS.
