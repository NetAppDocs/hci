== Workflow diagrams



== Prepare for installation

Here is a simplified NetApp HCI network topology installation:

image::hci_topology_simple_network.png[Simplified NetApp HCI Network Topology diagram]

== Install rails


== Install the chassis

NetApp HCI can be installed in different configurations:

* H410C compute nodes: Two-cable configuration or six-cable configuration
* H610C compute node: Two-cable configuration
* H615C compute node: Two-cable configuration
* H410S storage node
* H610S storage node

.Steps

. Install the rails and the chassis.
. Install nodes in the chassis and install drives for storage nodes. (Applies only if you are installing H410C and H410S in a NetApp H-series chassis.)
. Cable the compute node.
. Cable the storage node.
. Connect the power cords.
. Power on the NetApp HCI nodes.

== Cable the nodes

To ensure network readiness for NetApp HCI, install the NetApp Configuration Advisor 5.8.1 or later. This network validation tool is located with other link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/5ddb829ebd393e00015179b2[NetApp Support Tools^]. Use this tool to validate connectivity, VLAN IDs, IP address requirements, switch connectivity and more.


== Configure NetApp HCI

The NDE UI is the software wizard interface used to install NetApp HCI.

== Perform post-configuration tasks

NetApp HCI uses a storage node management network IPv4 address for initial access to the NDE.  As a best practice, connect from the first storage node.

.Prerequisites
*	You already assigned the initial storage node management network IP address manually or by using DHCP.
*	You must have physical access to the NetApp HCI installation.

.Steps

. If you do not know the initial storage node management network IP, use the Terminal User Interface (TUI), which is accessed via keyboard and monitor on the storage node or https://docs.netapp.com/hci/topic/com.netapp.doc.hci-ude-180/GUID-511EA889-41D6-471A-BE84-C3146350A082.html[use a USB stick^].

. If you do know the IP address, from a web browser, connect to the Bond1G address of the primary node via HTTP, not HTTPS.
