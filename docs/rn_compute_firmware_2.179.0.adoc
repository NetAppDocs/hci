[.lead]
The downloadable compute node firmware package contains the latest BIOS and BMC feature enhancements, bugfixes, and hardware support for all supported NetApp HCI compute nodes.

NOTE: NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control requires the latest management services bundle. You must upgrade to the latest management services bundle before upgrading the firmware on your compute nodes to version 2.179.0. If you are upgrading the firmware on your compute nodes to version 2.179.0, you need management services 2.20 to proceed.

== What's New
Version 2.179.0 contains general bugfixes.

=== Mellanox NIC firmware driver compatibility
The updated Mellanox firmware version 14.29.1016 requires a minimum version of VMware ESXi driver as follows:

*VMware ESXi Driver versions*
|===
| ESXi | Driver
| 7.0	| 4.19.71.101
4.19.71.1
| 7.0 Update 1 | 4.19.71.101
4.19.71.1
| 7.0 Update 2 | 4.21.71.101
4.21.71.1
| 7.0 Update 3 | 4.21.71.101
4.21.71.1
| 6.7 | 4.17.71.1
| 6.5 | 4.16.71.1
|===

IMPORTANT: For VMware ESXi version 8.0, see the following Knowledge Base article link:https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/solidfire/Element_OS_Kbs/What_is_supported_with_NetApp_HCI_and_VMware_ESX_version_8.0_and_beyond[What is supported with NetApp HCI and VMware ESXi version 8.0 and beyond?^] for further details.


NOTE: The drivers for 7.0, 7.0 U1, 7.0 U2, and 7.0 U3 are available from the link:https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/7_0[VMware vSphere download^] page.

NOTE: Before upgrading to version 2.179.0, you must check the current ESXi driver version. If the driver is out of date, upgrade the driver first. Then upgrade the compute firmware to version 2.179.0 for your compute nodes. Visit link:task_hcc_upgrade_compute_node_drivers.html[Update compute node drivers] for instructions on updating your compute node drivers, which include the ESXi driver.

When you manually install or upgrade host OSes, NetApp cannot control the drivers and firmware for these OSes.
