Before you begin using cloud services on NetApp HCI, it might be helpful to understand licensing.


== Licensing requirements for NetApp Kubernetes Service
NetApp Kubernetes Service does not require an additional license.

NetApp Kubernetes Service is metered and billed by the number of worker nodes in the managed Kubernetes clusters. While these Kubernetes worker nodes are virtual machines that are running on a cluster and NetApp HCI compute nodes, the number of physical compute nodes in the NetApp HCI environment are an unrelated entity for metering and billing purposes.
