You can use the management node (mNode) to upgrade system services, manage cluster assets and settings, run system tests and utilities, configure Active IQ for system monitoring, and enable NetApp Support access for troubleshooting.

For clusters running Element software version 11.3 or later, you can work with the management node by using one of two interfaces:

* With the management node UI (`https:// [mNode IP}:442`), you can make changes to network and cluster settings, run system tests, or use system utilities.
* With the built-in REST API UI (`https://[mNode IP}/mnode`), you can run or understand APIs relating to the management node services, including proxy server configuration, service level updates, or asset management.

Install or recover a management node:

* link:task_mnode_install_add_storage_NIC.html[Configure a storage Network Interface Controller (NIC)]
* link:task_mnode_recover.html[Recover a management node]

Access the management node:

* link:task_mnode_access_ui.html[Access the management node (UI or REST API)]

Tasks you can perform with the management node UI:

* link:task_mnode_settings.html[Modify and test the management node network, cluster, and system settings]
* link:task_mnode_run_system_utilities.html[Run system utilities from the management node]

Tasks you can perform with the management node REST APIs:

* link:task_mnode_api_get_authorizationtouse.html[Get authorization to use REST APIs]
* link:task_mnode_enable_activeIQ.html[Enable Active IQ and NetApp HCI monitoring]
* link:task_mnode_add_assets.html[Add compute and controller assets to the management node]
