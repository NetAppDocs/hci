[.lead]
After deploying Rancher on NetApp HCI, you can change Rancher credentials and view the Rancher server cluster URLs and status. You can also delete the Rancher server.


== Change the Rancher admin user credentials and URL

. Go to myrancher.org
. Change the password for the default Rancher admin user.
. Review and accept the terms.
. Click *Continue*.
+
Rancher displays a field where you can enter the Rancher URL.

. Enter the Rancher URL that you can use to access your Rancher deployment.
. Click *Save URL.*
+
The Rancher Clusters page shows the virtual machines.


== Identify Rancher server cluster URLs and status
You can identify Rancher server cluster URLs and determine server status.

. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the NetApp HCI or Element storage cluster administrator credentials.
. From the Dashboard, select on the top right Options icon and select *Configure*.

+
The Rancher Server Clusters page displays a list of Rancher server clusters that have been deployed, the associated URL and status.

== Delete a Rancher server instance

You can delete the Rancher server, which deletes the management clusters. This action does not delete the user clusters.

TIP: You might want to retain the user clusters. If you do retain them, you can later migrate them to another Rancher implementation. If you want to delete the user clusters, you should do that first before deleting the Rancher server; otherwise, deleting the user clusters after the Rancher server is deleted is more difficult.

. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the NetApp HCI or Element storage cluster administrator credentials.
. From the Dashboard, click on the top right Options icon and select *Configure*.
+

. From the Configuration page, select *Configure Rancher Server Clusters*.
+
CAUTION: Clicking *Delete* removes the Rancher on NetApp HCI implementation and removes all management clusters.

. Select the *Actions* ellipses and select *Delete*.
