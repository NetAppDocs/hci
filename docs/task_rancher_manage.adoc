After deploying Rancher on NetApp HCI, you can change Rancher credentials, set up user clusters, and provision user clusters.


== Change the Rancher admin user credentials and URL

. Go to myrancher.org
. Change the password for the default Rancher admin user.
. Review and accept the terms.
. Click *Continue*.
+
Rancher displays a field where you can enter the Rancher URL.

. Enter the Rancher URL that you can use to access your Rancher deployment.
. Click *Save URL.*
+
The Rancher Clusters page shows the virtual machines.

== Deploy user clusters
After deployment, Dev and Ops teams can then deploy their Kubernetes user clusters, similar to any Rancher deployment.

. Go to the Rancher URL provided to you at the end of the Rancher deployment.
. Access the Rancher UI using that URL.
. Create user clusters. See https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/workload/[Deploying workloads].
. Provision user clusters in Rancher on NetApp HCI. See https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/[Setting up Kubernetes clusters in Rancher].
