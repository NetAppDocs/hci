A volume access group is a collection of volumes that users can access using either iSCSI or Fibre Channel initiators.

By creating and using volume access groups, you can control access to a set of volumes. When you associate a set of volumes and a set of initiators with a volume access group, the access group grants those initiators access to that set of volumes.
