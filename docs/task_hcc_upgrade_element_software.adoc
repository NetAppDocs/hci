[.lead]
To upgrade to NetApp Element software 12.0, you must use the `sfinstall` file included in the HealthTools suite of tools. Certain operations are suppressed during an Element software upgrade, such as adding and removing nodes, adding and removing drives, and commands associated with initiators, volume access groups, and virtual networks, among others.

.What you'll need

* You have updated your management services bundle to the latest version.

IMPORTANT: You must upgrade to the latest management services bundle before upgrading your Element software to version 12.

* You have checked upgrade path information for the Element version you are upgrading to and verified that the upgrade path is valid.
https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1088254[NetApp KB 1088254: Upgrade matrix for storage clusters running NetApp Element Software]
* You have the latest version of HealthTools.
* You have verified that the cluster is ready to be upgraded. See link:task_hcc_upgrade_element_prechecks.html[Run Element storage health checks prior to upgrading storage].
* You have ensured that the system time on all nodes is synced and that NTP is correctly configured for the storage cluster and nodes. Each node must be configured with a DNS nameserver in the per-node web UI (`https://[IP address]:442`) with no unresolved cluster faults related to time skew.
* The management node in your environment is running version 11.0, 11.1 or later.

.Upgrade options

Choose one of the following Element software upgrade options:

* <<Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to upgrade Element storage>>
* <<Use HCC API to upgrade Element storage>>
* <<Upgrade Element software at connected sites using HealthTools>>
* <<Upgrade Element software at dark sites using HealthTools>>

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an H610S series node to Element 12.0 or later, you will need to upgrade Element software (phase 1) and then perform additional upgrade steps (phase 2) for each storage node. See <<Upgrading H610S storage nodes to Element 12.0 or later (phase 2)>> after you complete the `sfinstall` procedure with HealthTools.

== Use NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to upgrade Element storage

Using NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC), you can upgrade a storage cluster.

.Steps

. Open a web browser and browse to the IP address of the management node:
+
----
https://<ManagementNodeIP>
----
. Log in to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control by providing the storage cluster administrator credentials.
. Click image:hcc_upgrade_icon.png[upgrade icon] near the top right of the interface.
. On the *Upgrades* page, select *Storage*.
+
The *Storage* tab lists the storage clusters that are part of your installation. The drop-down arrow next to each cluster shows the compatible upgrade packages available.
+
image::hcc_storupgrade_versions.png[Storage tab in the HCC UI showing the upgrade packages available for a cluster.]

. Click the health check image:hcc_healthcheck_icon.png[icon] for the cluster you want to check for upgrade readiness.
. On the *Storage Health Check* page, click *Run Health Check*.
. If there are issues, do the following:
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, click *Re-Run Health Check*.
+
After the health check completes without errors, you can upgrade the storage cluster.
. Click the drop-down arrow next to the cluster you are upgrading, and do one of the following:

.. Select from the available packages.
. Click *Begin Upgrade*.

== Use HCC API to upgrade Element storage
You can use REST API to verify that a storage cluster is ready to be upgraded. The health check verifies that there are no obstacles to upgrading, such as pending nodes, disk space issues, and cluster faults.

.Steps

. Locate the storage cluster ID:
.. Open the management node REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://[management node IP]/mnode
----
.. Click *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Click *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. From the REST API UI, click *GET /assets/storage-clusters*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Click *Execute*.
.. From the response, copy the storage cluster ID (`"id"`) of the cluster you intend to check for upgrade readiness.
. Run health checks on the storage cluster:
.. Open the storage REST API UI on the management node:
+
----
https://[management node IP]/storage/1
----
.. Click *Authorize* and complete the following:
... Enter the cluster user name and password.
... Enter the client ID as `mnode-client` if the value is not already populated.
... Click *Authorize* to begin a session.
.. Click *POST /health-checks*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Enter the storage cluster ID in the parameter field.
.. Click *Execute* to run a health check on the specified storage cluster.
+
The response should indicate state as `initializing`:

. Verify the results of the health checks:
.. Click *GET ​/health-checks​/healthCheckId}*.
.. Click *Try it out*.
.. Enter the health check ID in the parameter field.
.. Click *Execute*.
.. Scroll to the bottom of the response body.
. If the `message` return indicates that there were problems regarding cluster health, do the following:
.. Go to the specific KB article listed for each issue or perform the specified remedy.
.. If a KB is specified, complete the process described in the relevant KB article.
.. After you have resolved cluster issues, run *GET ​/health-checks​/healthCheckId}* again.

If all health checks are successful, the return is similar to the following example:
----
"message": "All checks completed successfully.",
"percent": 100,
"timestamp": "2020-03-06T00:03:16.321621Z"

== Upgrade Element software at connected sites using HealthTools

.Steps

. For NetApp HCI systems, go to the NetApp HCI software https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/hci.html[download page]. For SolidFire storage systems, go to the Element software https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/element_software.html[download page].
. Select the correct software release and download the latest storage node image to a computer that is not the management node.
. Copy the ISO file to the management node in an accessible location like `/tmp`.
+
TIP: You can do this by using, for example, SCP.

+
When you upload the ISO file, make sure that the name of the file does not change, otherwise later steps will fail.

. *Optional*: Download the ISO from the management node to the cluster nodes before the upgrade.
+
This step reduces the upgrade time by pre-staging the ISO on the storage nodes and running additional internal checks to ensure that the cluster is in a good state to be upgraded. Performing this operation will not put the cluster into "upgrade" mode or restrict any of the cluster operations.
+
----
sfinstall <MVIP> -u <cluster_username> <path-toinstall-file-ISO> --stage
----
+
NOTE: Omit the password from the command line to allow `sfinstall` to prompt for the information. For passwords that contain special characters, add a backslash (`\`) before each special character. For example, `mypass!@1` should be entered as `mypass\!\@`.

+
*Example*
See the following sample input:
+
----
sfinstall 10.117.0.244 -u admin /tmp/solidfire-rtfisodium-11.0.0.345.iso --stage
----
+
The output for the sample shows that `sfinstall` attempts to verify if a newer version of `sfinstall` is available:
+
----

/tmp/solidfire-rtfisodium-11.0.0.345.iso 2018-10-01 16:52:15:
Newer version of sfinstall available.
This version: 2018.09.01.130, latest version: 2018.06.05.901.
The latest version of the HealthTools can be downloaded from:
https:// mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/software/
or rerun with --skip-version-check
----
See the following sample excerpt from a successful pre-stage operation:
+
NOTE: When staging completes, the message will display `Storage Node Upgrade Staging Successful` after the upgrade event.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an H610S series node to Element 12.0 or later, you will need to perform additional upgrade steps (phase 2) for each storage node. See <<Upgrading H610S storage nodes to Element 12.0 or later (phase 2)>>.

== Upgrade Element software at dark sites using HealthTools
You must use the HealthTools suite of tools to update NetApp Element software at a dark site.

.What you'll need

. For NetApp HCI systems, go to the NetApp HCI software https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/hci.html[download page]. For SolidFire storage systems, go to the Element software https://mysupport.netapp.com/products/p/element_software.html[download page].
. Select the correct software release and download the latest storage node image to a computer that is not the management node.
. Download this https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMLP2840740[JSON file] (https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_get_file/ECMLP2840740) from the NetApp Support Site on a computer that is not the management node and rename it to `metadata.json`.
. Copy the ISO file to the management node in an accessible location like `/tmp`.
+
TIP: You can do this by using, for example, SCP. When you upload the ISO file, make sure that the name of the file does not change, otherwise later steps will fail.

.Steps

. Run the `sfupdate-healthtools` command:
+
----
sfupdate-healthtools <path-to-healthtools-package>
----
. Check the installed version:
+
----
sfupdate-healthtools -v
----
. Check the latest version against the metadata JSON file:
+
----
sfupdate-healthtools -l --metadata=<path-to-metadata-json>
----
. Ensure that the cluster is ready:
+
----
sudo sfupgradecheck -u <cluster_username> -p <cluster_password> MVIP --metadata=<path-to-metadata-json>
----
. Run the `sfinstall` command with the path to the ISO file and the metadata JSON file:
+
----
sfinstall -u <cluster_username> <MVIP> <path-toinstall-file-ISO> --metadata=<path-to-metadata-json-file>
----
+
See the following sample input command:
+
----
sfinstall -u admin 10.117.78.244 /tmp/solidfire-rtfi-11.3.0.345.iso --metadata=/tmp/metadata.json
----
+
*Optional* You can add the `--stage` flag to the `sfinstall` command to pre-stage the upgrade in advance.

IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading an H610S series node to Element 12.0 or later, you will need to perform additional upgrade steps (phase 2) for each storage node. See <<Upgrading H610S storage nodes to Element 12.0 or later (phase 2)>>.

== What happens if an upgrade fails
If the software upgrade fails, you can pause the upgrade.

TIP: You should pause an upgrade only with Ctrl-C. This enables the system to clean itself up.

When `sfinstall` waits for cluster faults to clear and if any failure causes the faults to remain, `sfinstall` will not proceed to the next node.

.Steps
. You should stop `sfinstall` with Ctrl+C.
. Contact NetApp Support to assist with the failure investigation.
. Resume the upgrade with the same `sfinstall` command.
. When an upgrade is paused by using Ctrl+C, if the upgrade is currently upgrading a node, choose one of these options:

* *Wait*: Allow the currently upgrading node to finish before resetting the cluster constants.
* *Continue*: Continue the upgrade, which cancels the pause.
* *Abort*: Reset the cluster constants and abort the upgrade immediately.
+
NOTE: Aborting the cluster upgrade while a node is being updated might result in the drives being ungracefully removed from the node. If the drives are ungracefully removed, adding the drives back during an upgrade will require manual intervention by NetApp Support. The node might be taking longer to do firmware updates or post update syncing activities. If the upgrade progress seems stalled, contact NetApp Support for assistance.

== Upgrading H610S storage nodes to Element 12.0 or later (phase 2)

If you are upgrading an H610S series node to Element 12.0 or later, the upgrade process involves two phases.

Phase 1, which is performed first, follows the same steps as the standard upgrade to Element 12.0 process. It installs Element Software and all 5 firmware updates in a rolling fashion across the cluster one node at a time. Due to the firmware payload, the process is estimated to take approximately 1.5 to 2 hours per H610S node, including a single cold-boot cycle at the end of the upgrade for each node.

Phase 2 involves completing steps to perform a complete node shutdown and power disconnect for each H610S node that are described in a required https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1103627[KB^]. This phase is estimated to take approximately one hour per H610S node.

IMPORTANT: After you complete phase 1, four of the five firmware updates are activated during the cold boot on each H610S node; however, the Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) firmware requires a complete power disconnect and reconnect to fully install. The CPLD firmware update protects against NVDIMM failures and metadata drive eviction during future reboots or power cycles. This power reset is estimated to take approximately one hour per H610S node. It requires shutting down the node, removing power cables or disconnecting power via a smart PDU, waiting approximately 3 minutes, and reconnecting power.

.Before you begin

* You have completed phase 1 of the H610S upgrade process and have upgraded your storage nodes using one the standard Element storage upgrade procedures:
. <<Upgrade Element software at connected sites>>
. <<Upgrade Element software at dark sites>>

NOTE: Phase 2 requires on-site personnel.

.Steps

. (Phase 2) Complete the power reset process required for each H610S node in the cluster:

NOTE: If the cluster also has non-H610S nodes, these non-H610S nodes are exempt from phase 2 and do not need to be shut down or have their power disconnected.

.. Contact NetApp Support for assistance and to schedule this upgrade.
.. Follow the phase 2 upgrade procedure in this https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1103627[KB^] that is required to complete an upgrade for each H610S node.
