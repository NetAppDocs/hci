By default, the `smartd` service periodically polls the drives in your compute nodes. You should disable this service on all compute nodes after you deploy NetApp HCI.

.Steps
. Using SSH or a local console session, log in to VMware ESXi on the compute node using root credentials.
. Stop the running `smartd` service:
+
----
/etc/init.d/smartd stop
----
. Prevent the `smartd` service from starting at boot:
+
----
chkconfig smartd off
----
. Repeat these steps on the rest of the compute nodes in your installation.
