You might need to allow the following ports through your datacenter's edge firewall so that you can manage the system remotely, allow clients outside of your datacenter to connect to resources, and ensure that internal services can function properly. Some of these ports, URLs, or IP addresses might not be required, depending on how you use the system. All ports are TCP unless stated otherwise, and should be open bidirectionally.

NOTE: Some URLs or IP addresses might resolve to other URLs or IP addresses if the server is part of a content delivery network.

The following abbreviations are used in the table:

* MIP: Management IP address, a per-node address
* SIP: Storage IP address, a per-node address
* MVIP: Management virtual IP address
* SVIP: Storage virtual IP address
