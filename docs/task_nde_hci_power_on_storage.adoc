You can power on NetApp HCI after the scheduled outage is complete.

.Steps

. Power on all the storage nodes using either the physical power button or the BMC.
. If using the BMC, log in to each node and navigate to *Remote Control > Power Control > Power On Server*.
. When all the storage nodes are online, log in to the NetApp HCI storage system and verify that all nodes are operational.
