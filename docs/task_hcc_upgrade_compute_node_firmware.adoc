= Update compute node firmware

[.lead]
For any H-Series compute node, you can update the firmware for hardware components such as the BMC, BIOS, and NIC using the RTFI image while leaving the ESXi installation and other configuration data in place.

After the update, the compute node boots into ESXi and works as before, retaining the configuration.

.What you'll need

See the firmware and driver matrix for your hardware in https://kb.netapp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1088658[NetApp KB article 1088658] (login required).

TIP: It can take approximately 25 to 30 minutes for the update via the BMC.

.Update options

You can update the firmware using one of the following methods:

* <<Use a USB drive with the latest firmware image downloaded>>
* <<Follow the wizard in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) user interface (UI)>>

.About this task

In production environments, only update the firmware on one compute node at a time.

As an alternative to using the USB thumb drive method described in this procedure, you can mount the compute node RTFI image on the compute node using the *Virtual CD/DVD* option in the Virtual Console in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) interface. The BMC method takes considerably longer than the USB thumb drive method. Ensure your workstation or server has the necessary network bandwidth and that your browser session with the BMC does not time out.

== Use a USB drive with the latest firmware image downloaded

You can insert a USB drive with the latest firmware image downloaded into a USB port on the compute node.

.Steps

. Browse to the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/netapp-hci/downloads-tab[NetApp HCI software downloads] page and click the download link for correct version of NetApp HCI.
. Accept the End User License Agreement.
. Under the *Compute and Storage Nodes* heading, download the NetApp HCI compute node image.
. Write the raw contents of the compute node RTFI image to a USB thumb drive with at least 32GB capacity (using dd or Etcher).
. Place the compute node in maintenance mode using VMware vCenter, and evacuate all virtual machines from the host.
+
NOTE: If VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) is enabled on the cluster (this is the default in NetApp HCI installations), virtual machines will automatically be migrated to other nodes in the cluster.

. Insert the USB thumb drive into a USB port on the compute node and reboot the compute node using VMware vCenter.
. During the compute node POST cycle, press *F11* to open the Boot Manager. You may need to press *F11* multiple times in quick succession. You can perform this operation by connecting a video/keyboard or by using the console in `BMC`.
. Select *One Shot* > *USB Flash Drive* from the menu that appears. If the USB thumb drive does not appear in the menu, verify that USB Flash Drive is part of the legacy boot order in the BIOS of the system.
. Press *Enter* to boot the system from the USB thumb drive. The firmware flash process begins.
+
After firmware flashing is complete and the node reboots, it might take a few minutes for ESXi to start.
. After the reboot is complete, exit maintenance mode on the updated compute node using vCenter.
. Remove the USB flash drive from the updated compute node.
. Repeat this task for other compute nodes in your ESXi cluster until all compute nodes are updated.

== Follow the wizard in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) user interface (UI)

You must perform the sequential steps to load the compute firmware ISO and reboot the node to the ISO to ensure that the update is successful. The ISO should be located on the system or virtual machine (VM) hosting the web browser.

TIP: The recommendation is to have the system or VM and the node on the same network.

.Steps

. If your node is part of a cluster, place it in maintenance mode as follows:
.. Log in to the VMware vCenter web client.
.. Right-click the host (compute node) name and select *Maintenance Mode > Enter Maintenance Mode*.
.. Click *OK*.
VMs on the host will be migrated to another available host. VM migration can take time depending on the number of VMs that need to be migrated.
+
CAUTION: Ensure that all the VMs on the host are migrated before you proceed.

. Navigate to the BMC UI, `https://BMCIP/#login`, where BMC IP is the IP address of the BMC.
. Log in using your credentials.
. Select *Remote Control > Launch KVM (Java)*.
. On the console, select *Media > Virtual Media Wizard*.
+

. Click *Browse* and select the compute firmware `.iso` file.
. Click *Connect*.
A popup indicating success is displayed, along with the path and device showing at the bottom. You can close the *Virtual Media* window.
+

. Select either F12 and Restart or *Power Control > Set Power Reset* to reboot the node.
. During reboot, select the function key F11 to select the boot options and load the ISO.
. Select AMI Virtual CDROM from the list displayed and click *Enter*.
+

. On the screen displayed, click *Enter*.
+
NOTE: Some of the firmware updates might cause the console to disconnect and/or cause your session on the BMC to disconnect. You can log back into the BMC, however some services, such as the console, may not be available due to the firmware updates. After the updates have completed, the node will perform a cold reboot, which can take approximately five minutes.

. Select *Remote Control* and click *Launch KVM* or *Launch KVM (Java)* to verify that the node booted successfully.
+
CAUTION: During the powering on process, for approximately five minutes, the KVM console displays *No Signal*.

. After the node is powered on, select *Dashboard > Device Information > More info* to verify the BIOS and BMC versions.
. If you placed the node in maintenance mode, after the node boots to ESXi, right-click the host (compute node) name, and select *Maintenance Mode > Exit Maintenance Mode*, and migrate the VMs back to the host.
. In vCenter, with the host name selected, configure and verify the BIOS version.
