Enabling NetApp cloud services adds your local NetApp HCI system as a region to NetApp Cloud Central.

Enabling cloud services is performed using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.

.About this task
This lets you use NetApp Kubernetes Service and Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI on your on-premises private cloud. With the NetApp Kubernetes Service, you can deploy and manage
Kubernetes clusters.

A NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control wizard takes you through the following tasks:

* Select the cloud services you want to enable.
* Obtain a Kubernetes API token and register your installation with NetApp Cloud Central.
*	Select the vCenter resources.
*	Configure networking.

== Sign in to or register with NetApp Cloud Central

. Access NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control (HCC) by opening a web browser and browsing to the IP address of the management node:
"https://<_ManagementNodeIP_>"

+
For details, see http://docs.netapp.com/hci/topic/com.netapp.doc.hci-ude-170/GUID-6FC998B8-C6D4-48CF-A1A4-A762CC19092C.html[Accessing NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control^].

. Click the *Cloud* icon.
+
An outline of a cloud indicates that no services have been enabled. A filled in cloud indicates that some services have been enabled.
. In the Cloud Services popup, review the services that are available and click *Enable Cloud Services*.

== Select the Cloud Services you want to enable
SERVICES and INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED as a TECHNOLOGY PREVIEW. You might see a different set of services than those listed here.

. On the Services page, select the services that you want to enable.
* *NetApp Kubernetes Service*: You must use NetApp Kubernetes Service, a SaaS platform that enables you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud with the major cloud providers and also with a NetApp private cloud. This is required to enable cloud services on NetApp HCI. This service is installed as a VM on a NetApp HCI compute node.
* *Cloud Volumes*: To install Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI, select this service. This service offers an on-demand shared file systems feature on your premises. The Cloud Volumes option will enable Data Fabric replication to and from public clouds.
* *Cloud Insights*: This option will enable you to monitor cloud services on NetApp HCI. _Coming soon_.

. Click *Continue*.


== Get a Kubernetes API token
Enabling cloud services on NetApp HCI requires a NetApp Kubernetes Service API token that is associated with your Cloud Central account. You can complete these steps prior to enabling cloud services or during the process.

If you already have a NetApp Kubernetes Service API token, you can skip this procedure.

. On the Enable Cloud Services > NetApp Cloud Central page, click the *API token* link to get a Kubernetes Service API token if you do not already have one.
+
image::hcc_enablecloudservices_cloudcentral.png[Enable Cloud Services Cloud Central page]
. Enter a token name and click *Create*.
+
image::nks_api_token_copy.png[NKS API token page]

. Copy the token.
. Return to NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control and paste it into the NetApp Kubernetes Service API Token field.

. Click *Connect*.
+
The registration is now established and you are connected to Cloud Central. The Organization and Region Name fields appear listing the datacenters and regions available for this Cloud Central connection.

+

== Register your installation with NetApp Cloud Central

. On the NetApp Cloud Central page, select your Cloud Central organization and region name.
+
NOTE: This region name is used to identify this NetApp HCI installation and is used as the site name for any NetApp Kubernetes clusters created on this installation.
. Click *Continue* to go to the vCenter Resources page.

== Select the vCenter resources
Because the management node is connected to the vCenter, the vCenter used for deployment is displayed.

. On the vCenter page, enter or select the following:
.. *Datacenter*:  Select a datacenter from those configured on the NetApp HCI system.
.. *Cluster*: Select a cluster from those configured on the NetApp HCI system.
.. *Switch*: Select a switch. Only switches that meet the redundant management, vMotion, and storage uplinks are displayed.
+
The vCenter instance and admin user connected to it are displayed.
+

+
. Click *Continue*.


== Select networking options

.	On the Networking page, enter values for fields in each section:
* *NetApp Kubernetes Service Management Network*: Select the vSphere distributed port group to use for management traffic for the NKS service cluster. This network requires outbound Internet access.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service Workload Network*: Select the vSphere distributed port group to use for management traffic for the NKS user clusters, on which you place your applications. This network should have outbound Internet access.
*	*NetApp Kubernetes Service Data Network*: Select the vSphere distributed port group to use for persistent volume data traffic for the NKS user clusters. Storage or data networks require jumbo frames.
. Optionally, create a port group for all three NKS networks (management, workload, and data) or continue to create them separately in each section.
. Enter or select data in the fields in each section. Here are some tips. Default IP address, subnet, start and end IPs are provided for the data network.
* *NTP Server*: Enter the IP address or fully qualified domain name for the primary Network Time Protocol (NTP) server for NKS. Required only for the management and workload networks.
* *DNS Server*: Enter the primary DNS server IP address used for cluster communication for NKS. Required only for the management and workload networks.
* *DNS Search Domain*: Enter any additional domain name text for NKS. Required only for the management and workload networks.
* *Port Group*: The wizard provides three recommended NKS port groups and displays them in each section.
* *VLAN ID*: The VLAN must be in one of the port groups that you selected. The VLAN can be the same or different for the management and workload networks; however, the VLAN must be different for the data network.
* *Subnet*: Enter subnet definitions in CIDR format for each type of network traffic in each network, for example, 192.168.1.0/24
* *Default Gateway*: Enter the IP address of the default gateway for each type of network traffic in each section. Required only for the management and workload networks.
* *IP Addresses*: Enter starting and ending IP addresses. You must select a block of continuous IP addresses and they must be in the subnet. For the minimum IP requirements, see link:reference_requirements_beforeyoubegin.html[System requirements before you begin.]

. If you enabled Cloud Volumes on the Services page, the following additional fields appear:
* *Cloud Volumes Management Network*: Enter the IP addresses for managing the Cloud Volumes management VM and its deployed nodes.
* *Cloud Volumes Cluster Network*: Enter network information used by the nodes in the Cloud Volumes cluster to communicate with each other.
* *Cloud Volumes Storage Network*: Enter network information to serve data from Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI. This will become the network from which you access provisioned cloud volumes.

.	Click *Continue*.
.	On the Review page, review your choices by expanding each option. and click *Continue*.

.Result
NetApp HCI cloud services are enabled and the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control opening page reappears.

Click the cloud icon to see the number of services enabled.
The process can take up to 30 minutes for NKS and 60 minutes for NKS along with Cloud Volumes on NetApp HCI.

NetApp HCI uses the NetApp Kubernetes Service to create a service cluster, which is a Kubernetes cluster that consists of four VMs (one Kubernetes master node and three Kubernetes worker compute nodes).


== After you finish
Next, continue with link:task_NKS_create_cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes clusters] on your NetApp HCI system by using the NetApp Kubernetes Service.

Or, to create cloud volumes, create custom data management workflows, and manage data across volumes, use NetApp Fabric Orchestrator. See link:task_cv_managing.html[Manage data in NetApp Cloud Volumes].
