NetApp HCI​ installations connect to, register with, and become a deployable region with NetApp Cloud Central. With this, you can centrally manage cloud services for NetApp HCI on-premise systems in the same way that you do in public clouds.

== Deployment overview

Deploying and configuring a NetApp HCI solution in the cloud involves these steps.  Our user interfaces help you every step of the way:

* Deploy and configure NetApp HCI using the quick and easy NetApp Deployment Engine that you’ve used previously. See the http://docs.netapp.com/hci/index.jsp [NetApp HCI Deployment Guide in the NetApp HCI Documentation Center^].
* link:task_enabling_cloud_services.html[Enable cloud services] using the management node along with a NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control wizard. You establish a connection to NetApp Cloud Central and authenticate and register your NetApp HCI installation to your Cloud Central account.
* link:task_NKS_create_cluster.html[Create a Kubernetes cluster] using the NetApp Kubernetes Service, one of many services located on NetApp Cloud Central.
* link:task_nks_creating_projects.html[Create a Kubernetes project].
* link:task_NKS_adding_applications.html[Add applications to your Kubernetes cluster].
