[.lead]
You can configure NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control to manage assets from two or more vCenters that are not using Linked Mode.

You should use this process after your initial installation when you need to add assets for a recently scaled installation or when new assets were not added automatically to your configuration. Use these APIs to add assets that are recent additions to your installation.

.What you'll need
* Your cluster version is running NetApp Element software 11.3 or later.
* You have deployed a management node running version 11.3 or later.

.Steps
. link:task_mnode_add_assets.html[Add new vCenters as controller assets] to the management node configuration.
. link:task_mnode_add_assets.html[Add new compute nodes as compute assets] to the management node configuration.
+
NOTE: You might need to link:task_hcc_edit_bmc_info.html[change BMC credentials for compute nodes] to resolve a `Hardware ID not available` or `Unable to Detect` error indicated in NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control.

. Refresh the inventory service API on the management node:

NOTE: As an alternative, you can wait 2 minutes for the inventory to update in NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI.
