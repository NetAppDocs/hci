[.lead]
Starting with Element 12.0 and management services version 2.14, you can perform firmware-only upgrades on your storage nodes using the NetApp Hybrid Cloud Control UI and REST API. This procedure does not upgrade Element software and enables you to upgrade storage firmware outside of a major Element release.

== What's New
The storage firmware bundle version 2.146 contains various bug fixes and new features, including security vulnerability fixes. You can upgrade the storage firmware using the instructions in link:task_hcc_upgrade_storage_firmware.html[Upgrade storage firmware].
