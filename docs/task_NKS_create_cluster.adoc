[.lead]
After you enable cloud services, you can create Kubernetes user clusters on a NetApp HCI on-premise system using the NetApp Kubernetes Service.


== About this task
You create Kubernetes clusters, add them to a workspace, create a project within that workspace, and later add a solution to the project. After you create the clusters, those clusters are ready to accept application workloads, including predesigned or your own applications.

== Logging in to NetApp Cloud Central

. From https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^], select *Products* > *NetApp Kubernetes Service*.
. Log in using your Cloud Central credentials.

== Configuring your provider
. Select the region, the workspace in which the cluster will be located, and SSH key pair for the cluster.
+
TIP: In most cases you can just accept the defaults.

. To edit any of the default values for the cluster nodes, click *Edit* and customize the number, size, and disk space allotted to the cluster nodes. If there is more than one NetApp HCI installation in the organization, you can select additional systems.
. Click *Submit*.

== Configuring your cluster
.	Configure your Kubernetes cluster by entering the cluster name.
. Typically, use the default settings.
. Click *Submit*.

.Result
The NetApp Kubernetes Service creates the cluster and displays it on the Clusters page.

== After you finish
Continue with link:task_nks_creating_projects.html[Creating a project within a NetApp Kubernetes Service] workspace you specified so that you can later add applications or solutions to the project.
