Behind the scenes, NetApp HCI creates a bootstrap agent that establishes an encrypted communication tunnel to the NetApp Kubernetes Service control plane and creates a service cluster.

The _service cluster_, connected to NetApp Kubernetes Service, acts as a service orchestrator to deploy services and update itself. The NetApp Kubernetes Service agent maintains the tunnel and maintains deployed service clusters.

The NetApp Kubernetes Service also enables you to create _workload clusters_ on which you can place applications or solutions.

After a service cluster is deployed on your system, NetApp HCI is able to push requested software along with updates to your NetApp HCI systems.
